When the king learned that the body of the thief had been taken, he was beside himself and, obsessed with finding who it was who had managed this, did as followsâ€”they say, but I do not believe it.
<p><span class="section">2</span> He put his own daughter in a brothel, instructing her to accept all alike and, before having intercourse, to make each tell her the shrewdest and most impious thing he had done in his life; whoever told her the story of the thief, she was to seize and not let get out.
<p><span class="section">3</span> The girl did as her father told her, and the thief, learning why she was doing this, did as follows, wanting to get the better of the king by craft.
<p><span class="section">4</span> He cut the arm off a fresh corpse at the shoulder, and went to the king's daughter, carrying it under his cloak, and when asked the same question as the rest, he said that his most impious act had been when he had cut the head off his brother who was caught in a trap in the king's treasury; and his shrewdest, that after making the guards drunk he had cut down his brother's hanging body.
<p><span class="section">5</span> When she heard this, the princess grabbed for him; but in the darkness the thief let her have the arm of the corpse; and clutching it, she held on, believing that she had the arm of the other; but the thief, after giving it to her, was gone in a flash out the door.
