Dead cats are taken away to sacred buildings in the town of Bubastis, where they are embalmed and buried; female dogs are buried by the townsfolk in their own towns in sacred coffins; and the like is done with mongooses. Shrewmice and hawks are taken away to Buto, ibises to the city of Hermes.
<p><span class="section">2</span> There are few bears, and the wolves are little bigger than foxes; both these are buried wherever they are found lying.
