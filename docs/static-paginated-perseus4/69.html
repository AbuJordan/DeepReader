Some of the Egyptians consider crocodiles sacred; others do not, but treat them as enemies. Those who live near Thebes
 and lake Moeris consider them very sacred.
<p><span class="section">2</span> Every household raises one crocodile, trained to be tame; they put ornaments of glass and gold on its ears and bracelets on its forefeet, provide special food and offerings for it, and give the creatures the best of treatment while they live; after death, the crocodiles are embalmed and buried in sacred coffins.
<p><span class="section">3</span> But around Elephantine they are not held sacred, and are even eaten. The Egyptians do not call them crocodiles, but khampsae. The Ionians named them crocodiles, from their resemblance to the lizards which they have in their walls.
