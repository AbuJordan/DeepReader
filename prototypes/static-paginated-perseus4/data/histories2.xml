<milestone unit="para" />After the death of <name type="pers">Cyrus</name>, <name type="pers">Cambyses</name> inherited his throne. He was the son of <name type="pers">Cyrus</name> and of <name type="pers">Cassandane</name>, the daughter of <name type="pers">Pharnaspes</name>, for whom <name type="pers">Cyrus</name> mourned deeply when she died before him, and had all his subjects mourn also.
<milestone n="2" unit="section" />
<name type="pers">Cambyses</name> was the son of this woman and of <name type="pers">Cyrus</name>. He considered the <name type="ethnic">Ionians</name> and <name type="ethnic">Aeolians</name> slaves inherited from his father, and prepared an expedition against <name key="tgn,7016833" type="place" reg="Egypt [30,27] (nation), Africa "><placeName key="tgn,7016833" authname="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName></name>, taking with him some of these <name type="ethnic">Greek</name> subjects besides others whom he ruled.

<milestone n="2" unit="chapter" /><milestone n="1" unit="section" />
<milestone unit="para" />Now before <name type="pers">Psammetichus</name> became king of <name key="tgn,7016833" type="place" reg="Egypt [30,27] (nation), Africa "><placeName key="tgn,7016833" authname="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName></name>,<note anchored="yes" resp="ed" place="unspecified">In <date value="-664" authname="-664">664</date> B.C., probably.</note> the <name type="ethnic">Egyptians</name> believed that they were the oldest people on earth. But ever since <name type="pers">Psammetichus</name> became king and wished to find out which people were the oldest, they have believed that the <name type="ethnic">Phrygians</name> were older than they, and they than everybody else.
<milestone n="2" unit="section" />
<name type="pers">Psammetichus</name>, when he was in no way able to learn by inquiry which people had first come into being, devised a plan by which he took two newborn children of the common people and gave them to a shepherd to bring up among his flocks. He gave instructions that no one was to speak a word in their hearing; they were to stay by themselves in a lonely hut, and in due time the shepherd was to bring goats and give the children their milk and do everything else necessary.
<milestone n="3" unit="section" />
<name type="pers">Psammetichus</name> did this, and gave these instructions, because he wanted to hear what speech would first come from the children, when they were past the age of indistinct babbling. And he had his wish; for one day, when the shepherd had done as he was told for two years, both children ran to him stretching out their hands and calling “Bekos!” as he opened the door and entered.
<milestone n="4" unit="section" />When he first heard this, he kept quiet about it; but when, coming often and paying careful attention, he kept hearing this same word, he told his master at last and brought the children into the king's presence as required. <name type="pers">Psammetichus</name> then heard them himself, and asked to what language the word “Bekos” belonged; he found it to be a <name type="ethnic">Phrygian</name> word, signifying bread.
<milestone n="5" unit="section" />Reasoning from this, the <name type="ethnic">Egyptians</name> acknowledged that the <name type="ethnic">Phrygians</name> were older than they. This is the story which I heard from the priests of <name type="pers">Hephaestus</name>'<note anchored="yes" resp="ed" place="unspecified">Identified by the <name type="ethnic">Greeks</name> with the <name type="ethnic">Egyptian</name> <name type="pers">Ptah</name>.</note> temple at <name key="tgn,7001186" type="place" reg="Mit Rahina [31.25,29.85] (inhabited place), Giza, Upper Egypt, Egypt, Africa"><placeName key="tgn,7001186" authname="tgn,7001186">Memphis</placeName></name>; the <name type="ethnic">Greeks</name> say among many foolish things that <name type="pers">Psammetichus</name> had the children reared by women whose tongues he had cut out.

<milestone n="3" unit="chapter" /><milestone n="1" unit="section" />
<milestone unit="para" />Besides this story of the rearing of the children, I also heard other things at <name key="tgn,7001186" type="place" reg="Mit Rahina [31.25,29.85] (inhabited place), Giza, Upper Egypt, Egypt, Africa"><placeName key="tgn,7001186" authname="tgn,7001186">Memphis</placeName></name> in conversation with the priests of <name type="pers">Hephaestus</name>;<note anchored="yes" resp="ed" place="unspecified">Identified by the <name type="ethnic">Greeks</name> with the <name type="ethnic">Egyptian</name> <name type="pers">Ptah</name>.</note> and I visited <name key="tgn,7001297" type="place" reg="Thebes [32.666,25.683] (deserted settlement), Qina, Upper Egypt, Egypt, Africa"><placeName key="tgn,7001297" authname="tgn,7001297">Thebes</placeName></name>
 and <name key="tgn,7001183" type="place" reg="Heliopolis [31.333,30.1] (deserted settlement), Cairo, Urban, Egypt, Africa"><placeName key="tgn,7001183" authname="tgn,7001183">Heliopolis</placeName></name>, too, for this very purpose, because I wished to know if the people of those places would tell me the same story as the priests at <name key="tgn,7001186" type="place" reg="Mit Rahina [31.25,29.85] (inhabited place), Giza, Upper Egypt, Egypt, Africa"><placeName key="tgn,7001186" authname="tgn,7001186">Memphis</placeName></name>; for the people of <name key="tgn,7001183" type="place" reg="Heliopolis [31.333,30.1] (deserted settlement), Cairo, Urban, Egypt, Africa "><placeName key="tgn,7001183" authname="tgn,7001183">Heliopolis</placeName></name> are said to be the most learned of the <name type="ethnic">Egyptians</name>.
<milestone n="2" unit="section" />Now, such stories as I heard about the gods I am not ready to relate, except their names, for I believe that all men are equally knowledgeable about them; and I shall say about them what I am constrained to say by the course of my history.

<milestone n="4" unit="chapter" /><milestone n="1" unit="section" />
<milestone unit="para" />But as to human affairs, this was the account in which they all agreed: the <name type="ethnic">Egyptians</name>, they said, were the first men who reckoned by years and made the year consist of twelve divisions of the seasons. They discovered this from the stars (so they said). And their reckoning is, to my mind, a juster one than that of the <name type="ethnic">Greeks</name>; for the <name type="ethnic">Greeks</name> add an intercalary month every other year, so that the seasons agree; but the <name type="ethnic">Egyptians</name>, reckoning thirty days to each of the twelve months, add five days in every year over and above the total, and thus the completed circle of seasons is made to agree with the calendar.
<milestone n="2" unit="section" />Furthermore, the <name type="ethnic">Egyptians</name> (they said) first used the names of twelve gods<note anchored="yes" resp="ed" place="unspecified">There is much obscurity about the “Twelve Gods.” This only appears to be clear, that eight (or nine) gods form the first order of the <name type="ethnic">Egyptian</name> hierarchy, and that there are twelve of the second rank. See <bibl n="Hdt. 2.43" default="NO" valid="yes">Hdt. 2.43</bibl>, and <name type="pers">Rawlinson</name>'s essay (ch. 3 in his Appendix to Book II.).</note> (which the <name type="ethnic">Greeks</name> afterwards borrowed from them); and it was they who first assigned to the several gods their altars and images and temples, and first carved figures on stone. Most of this they showed me in fact to be the case. The first human king of <name key="tgn,7016833" type="place" reg="Egypt [30,27] (nation), Africa "><placeName key="tgn,7016833" authname="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName></name>, they said, was <name type="pers">Min</name>.
<milestone n="3" unit="section" />In his time all of <name key="tgn,7016833" type="place" reg="Egypt [30,27] (nation), Africa "><placeName key="tgn,7016833" authname="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName></name> except the <name type="ethnic">Thebaic</name><note anchored="yes" resp="ed" place="unspecified">the southern part of <name key="tgn,7001437" type="place" reg="Upper Egypt [32,26] (region), Egypt, Africa "><placeName key="tgn,7001437" authname="tgn,7001437">Upper Egypt</placeName></name>.</note> district was a marsh: all the country that we now see was then covered by water, north of <name key="tgn,1118985" type="place" reg="Birkat Qarun [30.666,29.466] (salt lake), Egypt, Africa"><placeName key="tgn,1118985" authname="tgn,1118985">lake Moeris</placeName></name>,<note anchored="yes" resp="ed" place="unspecified">In the modern <name key="tgn,7001105" type="place" reg="Al-Fayyum [30.8,29.316] (governorate), Upper Egypt, Egypt, Africa"><placeName key="tgn,7001105" authname="tgn,7001105">Fayyum</placeName></name>, west of the <name key="tgn,1127805" type="place" reg="Nahr an- Nil [31.1,30.166] (river), Africa"><placeName key="tgn,1127805" authname="tgn,1127805">Nile</placeName></name>.</note> which is seven days' journey up the river from the sea.

<milestone n="5" unit="chapter" /><milestone n="1" unit="section" />
<milestone unit="para" />And I think that their account of the country was true. For even if a man has not heard it before, he can readily see, if he has sense, that that <name key="tgn,7016833" type="place" reg="Egypt [30,27] (nation), Africa "><placeName key="tgn,7016833" authname="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName></name> to which the <name type="ethnic">Greeks</name> sail is land deposited for the <name type="ethnic">Egyptians</name>, the river's gift—not only the lower country, but even the land as far as three days' voyage above the lake, which is of the same nature as the other, although the priests did not say this, too.
<milestone n="2" unit="section" />For this is the nature of the land of <name key="tgn,7016833" type="place" reg="Egypt [30,27] (nation), Africa "><placeName key="tgn,7016833" authname="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName></name>: in the first place, when you approach it from the sea and are still a day's sail from land, if you let down a sounding line you will bring up mud from a depth of eleven fathoms. This shows that the deposit from the land reaches this far.

<milestone n="6" unit="chapter" /><milestone n="1" unit="section" />
<milestone unit="para" />Further, the length of the seacoast of <name key="tgn,7016833" type="place" reg="Egypt [30,27] (nation), Africa "><placeName key="tgn,7016833" authname="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName></name> itself is sixty “schoeni”<note anchored="yes" resp="ed" place="unspecified">Literally “ropes.”</note> —of <name key="tgn,7016833" type="place" reg="Egypt [30,27] (nation), Africa "><placeName key="tgn,7016833" authname="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName></name>, that is, as we judge it to be, reaching from the <name type="place">Plinthinete gulf</name> to the <name type="place">Serbonian marsh</name>, which is under the <name type="place">Casian mountain</name>—between these there is this length of sixty schoeni.
<milestone n="2" unit="section" />Men that have scant land measure by feet; those that have more, by miles; those that have much land, by parasangs; and those who have great abundance of it, by schoeni.
<milestone n="3" unit="section" />The parasang is three and three quarters miles, and the schoenus, which is an <name type="ethnic">Egyptian</name> measure, is twice that.

<milestone n="7" unit="chapter" /><milestone n="1" unit="section" />
<milestone unit="para" />By this reckoning, then, the seaboard of <name key="tgn,7016833" type="place" reg="Egypt [30,27] (nation), Africa "><placeName key="tgn,7016833" authname="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName></name> will be four hundred and fifty miles in length. Inland from the sea as far as <name key="tgn,7001183" type="place" reg="Heliopolis [31.333,30.1] (deserted settlement), Cairo, Urban, Egypt, Africa "><placeName key="tgn,7001183" authname="tgn,7001183">Heliopolis</placeName></name>, <name key="tgn,7016833" type="place" reg="Egypt [30,27] (nation), Africa "><placeName key="tgn,7016833" authname="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName></name> is a wide land, all flat and watery and marshy. From the sea up to <name key="tgn,7001183" type="place" reg="Heliopolis [31.333,30.1] (deserted settlement), Cairo, Urban, Egypt, Africa "><placeName key="tgn,7001183" authname="tgn,7001183">Heliopolis</placeName></name> is a journey about as long as the way from the altar of the twelve gods at <name key="perseus,Athens" type="place" reg="Athens [23.7333,37.9667] (Perseus)"><placeName key="perseus,Athens" authname="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName></name> to the temple of <name type="pers">Olympian Zeus</name> at <name key="perseus,Pisa" type="place" reg="Pisa [21.65,37.65] (Perseus)"><placeName key="perseus,Pisa" authname="perseus,Pisa">Pisa</placeName></name>.
<milestone n="2" unit="section" />If a reckoning is made, only a little difference of length, not more than two miles, will be found between these two journeys; for the journey from <name key="perseus,Athens" type="place" reg="Athens [23.7333,37.9667] (Perseus)"><placeName key="perseus,Athens" authname="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName></name> to <name key="perseus,Pisa" type="place" reg="Pisa [21.65,37.65] (Perseus) "><placeName key="perseus,Pisa" authname="perseus,Pisa">Pisa</placeName></name> is two miles short of two hundred, which is the number of miles between the sea and <name key="tgn,7001183" type="place" reg="Heliopolis [31.333,30.1] (deserted settlement), Cairo, Urban, Egypt, Africa "><placeName key="tgn,7001183" authname="tgn,7001183">Heliopolis</placeName></name>.

<milestone n="8" unit="chapter" /><milestone n="1" unit="section" />
<milestone unit="para" />Beyond and above <name key="tgn,7001183" type="place" reg="Heliopolis [31.333,30.1] (deserted settlement), Cairo, Urban, Egypt, Africa "><placeName key="tgn,7001183" authname="tgn,7001183">Heliopolis</placeName></name>, <name key="tgn,7016833" type="place" reg="Egypt [30,27] (nation), Africa "><placeName key="tgn,7016833" authname="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName></name> is a narrow land. For it is bounded on the one side by the mountains of <name key="tgn,1012700" type="place" reg="Arabian Peninsula [45,25] (region (general)), Asia"><placeName key="tgn,1012700" authname="tgn,1012700">Arabia</placeName></name>, which run north to south, always running south towards the sea called the <name type="place"><placeName key="tgn,7016791" authname="tgn,7016791">Red Sea</placeName></name>. In these mountains are the quarries that were hewn out for making the pyramids at <name key="tgn,7001186" type="place" reg="Mit Rahina [31.25,29.85] (inhabited place), Giza, Upper Egypt, Egypt, Africa"><placeName key="tgn,7001186" authname="tgn,7001186">Memphis</placeName></name>. This way, then, the mountains run, and end in the places of which I have spoken; their greatest width from east to west, as I learned by inquiry, is a two months' journey, and their easternmost boundaries yield frankincense.
<milestone n="2" unit="section" />Such are these mountains. On the side of <name key="tgn,1000172" type="place" reg="Libya [17,25] (nation), Africa"><placeName key="tgn,1000172" authname="tgn,1000172">Libya</placeName></name>, <name key="tgn,7016833" type="place" reg="Egypt [30,27] (nation), Africa "><placeName key="tgn,7016833" authname="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName></name> is bounded by another range of rocky mountains among which are the pyramids; these are all covered with sand, and run in the same direction as those <name type="ethnic">Arabian</name> hills that run southward.
<milestone n="3" unit="section" />Beyond <name key="tgn,7001183" type="place" reg="Heliopolis [31.333,30.1] (deserted settlement), Cairo, Urban, Egypt, Africa "><placeName key="tgn,7001183" authname="tgn,7001183">Heliopolis</placeName></name>, there is no great distance—in <name key="tgn,7016833" type="place" reg="Egypt [30,27] (nation), Africa "><placeName key="tgn,7016833" authname="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName></name>, that is:<note anchored="yes" resp="ed" place="unspecified"><foreign lang="greek">ὡς εἶναι αἰγύπτου</foreign>; so much of the <name type="place">Nile valley</name> being outside <name key="tgn,7016833" type="place" reg="Egypt [30,27] (nation), Africa "><placeName key="tgn,7016833" authname="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName></name>. But it is possible that the words may mean “no great distance, for <name key="tgn,7016833" type="place" reg="Egypt [30,27] (nation), Africa "><placeName key="tgn,7016833" authname="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName></name>,” i.e. no great distance relatively to the size of the country.</note> the narrow land has a length of only fourteen days' journey up the river. Between the aforesaid mountain ranges, the land is level, and where the plain is narrowest it seemed to me that there were no more than thirty miles between the <name type="place">Arabian mountains</name> and those that are called <name type="ethnic">Libyan</name>. Beyond this <name key="tgn,7016833" type="place" reg="Egypt [30,27] (nation), Africa "><placeName key="tgn,7016833" authname="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName></name> is a wide land again. Such is the nature of this country.

<milestone unit="para" />The greater portion, then, of this country of which I have spoken was land deposited for the <name type="ethnic">Egyptians</name> as the priests told me, and I myself formed the same judgment; all that lies between the ranges of mountains above <name key="tgn,7001186" type="place" reg="Mit Rahina [31.25,29.85] (inhabited place), Giza, Upper Egypt, Egypt, Africa"><placeName key="tgn,7001186" authname="tgn,7001186">Memphis</placeName></name> to which I have referred seemed to me to have once been a gulf of the sea, just as the country about <name key="tgn,7002329" type="place" reg="Troy [26.25,39.95] (deserted settlement), Canakkale, Marmara, Turkey, Asia"><placeName key="tgn,7002329" authname="tgn,7002329">Ilion</placeName></name> and <name type="place">Teuthrania</name> and <name key="tgn,7002499" type="place" reg="Ephesus [27.316,37.916] (deserted settlement), Izmir Ili, Ege kiyilari, Turkey, Asia "><placeName key="tgn,7002499" authname="tgn,7002499">Ephesus</placeName></name> and the plain of the <name key="tgn,1121561" type="place" reg="Buyukmenderes Nehri [27.183,37.466] (river), Turkey, Asia "><placeName key="tgn,1121561" authname="tgn,1121561">Maeander</placeName></name>, to compare these small things with great.

<milestone n="20" unit="chapter" /><milestone n="1" unit="section" />
<milestone unit="para" />But some of the <name type="ethnic">Greeks</name>, wishing to be notable for cleverness, put forward three opinions about this river, two of which I would not even mention except just to show what they are.
<milestone n="2" unit="section" />One of them maintains that the <name type="ethnic">Etesian</name> winds<note anchored="yes" resp="ed" place="unspecified">The regular N.W. winds which blow in summer from the <name key="tgn,7016735" type="place" reg="Mediterranean Sea [30,31.5] (sea)"><placeName key="tgn,7016735" authname="tgn,7016735">Mediterranean</placeName></name>.</note> are the cause of the river being in flood, because they hinder the <name key="tgn,1127805" type="place" reg="Nahr an- Nil [31.1,30.166] (river), Africa"><placeName key="tgn,1127805" authname="tgn,1127805">Nile</placeName></name> from emptying into the sea. But there are many times when the <name type="ethnic">Etesian</name> winds do not blow, yet the <name key="tgn,1127805" type="place" reg="Nahr an- Nil [31.1,30.166] (river), Africa"><placeName key="tgn,1127805" authname="tgn,1127805">Nile</placeName></name> does the same as before.
<milestone n="3" unit="section" />And further, if the <name type="ethnic">Etesian</name> winds were the cause, then the other rivers which flow contrary to those winds should be affected like the <name key="tgn,1127805" type="place" reg="Nahr an- Nil [31.1,30.166] (river), Africa"><placeName key="tgn,1127805" authname="tgn,1127805">Nile</placeName></name>, and even more so, since being smaller they have a weaker current. Yet there are many rivers in <name key="tgn,1000140" type="place" reg="Syria [38,35] (nation), Asia "><placeName key="tgn,1000140" authname="tgn,1000140">Syria</placeName></name> and many in <name key="tgn,1000172" type="place" reg="Libya [17,25] (nation), Africa"><placeName key="tgn,1000172" authname="tgn,1000172">Libya</placeName></name>, and they behave nothing like the <name key="tgn,1127805" type="place" reg="Nahr an- Nil [31.1,30.166] (river), Africa"><placeName key="tgn,1127805" authname="tgn,1127805">Nile</placeName></name>.

<milestone n="21" unit="chapter" /><milestone n="1" unit="section" />
<milestone unit="para" />The second opinion is less grounded on knowledge than the previous, though it is more marvellous to the ear: according to it, the river effects what it does because it flows from Ocean, which flows around the whole world.

<milestone n="22" unit="chapter" /><milestone n="1" unit="section" />
<milestone unit="para" />The third opinion is by far the most plausible, yet the most erroneous of all. It has no more truth in it than the others. According to this, the <name key="tgn,1127805" type="place" reg="Nahr an- Nil [31.1,30.166] (river), Africa"><placeName key="tgn,1127805" authname="tgn,1127805">Nile</placeName></name> flows from where snows melt; but it flows from <name key="tgn,1000172" type="place" reg="Libya [17,25] (nation), Africa"><placeName key="tgn,1000172" authname="tgn,1000172">Libya</placeName></name> through the midst of <name key="tgn,7000489" type="place" reg="Ethiopia [39,8] (nation), Africa"><placeName key="tgn,7000489" authname="tgn,7000489">Ethiopia</placeName></name>, and comes out into <name key="tgn,7016833" type="place" reg="Egypt [30,27] (nation), Africa "><placeName key="tgn,7016833" authname="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName></name>.
<milestone n="2" unit="section" />How can it flow from snow, then, seeing that it comes from the hottest places to lands that are for the most part cooler? In fact, for a man who can reason about such things, the principal and strongest evidence that the river is unlikely to flow from snows is that the winds blowing from <name key="tgn,1000172" type="place" reg="Libya [17,25] (nation), Africa"><placeName key="tgn,1000172" authname="tgn,1000172">Libya</placeName></name> and <name key="tgn,7000489" type="place" reg="Ethiopia [39,8] (nation), Africa"><placeName key="tgn,7000489" authname="tgn,7000489">Ethiopia</placeName></name> are hot.
<milestone n="3" unit="section" />In the second place, the country is rainless and frostless; but after snow has fallen, it has to rain within five days<note anchored="yes" resp="ed" place="unspecified">It does not seem to be known what authority there is for this assertion.</note> ; so that if it snowed, it would rain in these lands. And thirdly, the men of the country are black because of the heat.
<milestone n="4" unit="section" />Moreover, kites and swallows live there all year round, and cranes come every year to these places to winter there, flying from the wintry weather of <name key="tgn,6005315" type="place" reg="Scythia (region (general)), Asia"><placeName key="tgn,6005315" authname="tgn,6005315">Scythia</placeName></name>.

<milestone n="23" unit="chapter" /><milestone n="1" unit="section" />
<milestone unit="para" />The opinion about Ocean is grounded in obscurity and needs no disproof; for I know of no Ocean river; and I suppose that Homer or some older poet invented this name and brought it into his poetry.

<milestone n="24" unit="chapter" /><milestone n="1" unit="section" />
<milestone unit="para" />If, after having condemned the opinions proposed, I must indicate what I myself think about these obscure matters, I shall say why I think the <name key="tgn,1127805" type="place" reg="Nahr an- Nil [31.1,30.166] (river), Africa"><placeName key="tgn,1127805" authname="tgn,1127805">Nile</placeName></name> floods in the summer. During the winter, the sun is driven by storms from his customary course and passes over the inland parts of <name key="tgn,1000172" type="place" reg="Libya [17,25] (nation), Africa"><placeName key="tgn,1000172" authname="tgn,1000172">Libya</placeName></name>.
<milestone n="2" unit="section" />For the briefest demonstration, everything has been said; for whatever country this god is nearest, or over, it is likely that that land is very thirsty for water and that the local rivers are dried up.

<milestone n="25" unit="chapter" /><milestone n="1" unit="section" />
<milestone unit="para" />A lengthier demonstration goes as follows. In its passage over the inland parts of <name key="tgn,1000172" type="place" reg="Libya [17,25] (nation), Africa"><placeName key="tgn,1000172" authname="tgn,1000172">Libya</placeName></name>, the sun does this: as the air is always clear in that region, the land warm, and the winds cool, the sun does in its passage exactly as it would do in the summer passing through the middle of the heaven:
<milestone n="2" unit="section" />
it draws the water to itself, and having done so, expels it away to the inland regions, and the winds catch it and scatter and dissolve it; and, as is to be expected, those that blow from that country, the south and the southwest, are the most rainy of all winds.
<milestone n="3" unit="section" />Yet I think that the sun never lets go of all of the water that it draws up from the <name key="tgn,1127805" type="place" reg="Nahr an- Nil [31.1,30.166] (river), Africa"><placeName key="tgn,1127805" authname="tgn,1127805">Nile</placeName></name> yearly, but keeps some back near itself. Then, as the winter becomes milder, the sun returns to the middle of the heaven, and after that draws from all rivers alike.
<milestone n="4" unit="section" />Meanwhile, the other rivers are swollen to high flood by the quantity of water that falls into them from the sky, because the country is rained on and cut into gullies; but in the summer they are low, lacking the rain and being drawn up too by the sun.
<milestone n="5" unit="section" />But the <name key="tgn,1127805" type="place" reg="Nahr an- Nil [31.1,30.166] (river), Africa"><placeName key="tgn,1127805" authname="tgn,1127805">Nile</placeName></name>, being fed by no rain, and being the only river drawn up by the sun in winter, at this time falls far short of the height that it had in summer; which is but natural; for in summer all other waters too and not it alone are attracted to the sun, but in the winter it alone is afflicted.

<milestone n="26" unit="chapter" /><milestone n="1" unit="section" />
<milestone unit="para" />I am convinced, therefore, that the sun is the cause of this phenomenon. The dryness of the air in these parts is also caused by the sun, in my opinion, because it burns its way through it; hence, it is always summer in the inland part of <name key="tgn,1000172" type="place" reg="Libya [17,25] (nation), Africa"><placeName key="tgn,1000172" authname="tgn,1000172">Libya</placeName></name>.
<milestone n="2" unit="section" />But were the stations of the seasons changed, so that the south wind and the summer had their station where the north wind and winter are now set, and the north wind was where the south wind is now—if this were so, the sun, when driven from mid-heaven by the winter and the north wind, would pass over the inland parts of <name key="tgn,1000003" type="place" reg="Europe (continent)"><placeName key="tgn,1000003" authname="tgn,1000003">Europe</placeName></name> as it now passes over <name key="tgn,1000172" type="place" reg="Libya [17,25] (nation), Africa"><placeName key="tgn,1000172" authname="tgn,1000172">Libya</placeName></name>, and I think that in its passage over all <name key="tgn,1000003" type="place" reg="Europe (continent)"><placeName key="tgn,1000003" authname="tgn,1000003">Europe</placeName></name> it would have the same effect on the <name type="place">Ister</name> as it now does on the <name key="tgn,1127805" type="place" reg="Nahr an- Nil [31.1,30.166] (river), Africa"><placeName key="tgn,1127805" authname="tgn,1127805">Nile</placeName></name>.

<milestone n="27" unit="chapter" /><milestone n="1" unit="section" />
<milestone unit="para" />And as to why no breeze blows from the river, this is my opinion: it is not natural that any breeze blow from very hot places; breezes always come from that which is very cold.

<milestone n="28" unit="chapter" /><milestone n="1" unit="section" />
<milestone unit="para" />Let this be, then, as it is and as it was in the beginning. But as to the sources of the <name key="tgn,1127805" type="place" reg="Nahr an- Nil [31.1,30.166] (river), Africa"><placeName key="tgn,1127805" authname="tgn,1127805">Nile</placeName></name>, no one that conversed with me, <name type="ethnic">Egyptian</name>, <name type="ethnic">Libyan</name>, or <name type="ethnic">Greek</name>, professed to know them, except the recorder of the sacred treasures of <name type="pers">Athena</name> in the <name type="ethnic">Egyptian</name> city of <name type="place">Saïs</name>.

<milestone n="5" unit="section" />This recorder, then, if he spoke the truth, showed, I think, that there are strong eddies and an upward flow of water, such that with the stream rushing against the hills the sounding-line when let down cannot reach bottom.

<milestone n="3" unit="section" />If it is clean in all these respects, the priest marks it by wrapping papyrus around the horns, then smears it with sealing-earth and stamps it with his ring; and after this they lead the bull away.

<milestone n="2" unit="section" />They flay the carcass of the victim, then invoke many curses on its head, which they carry away.

<milestone n="2" unit="section" />After praying in the foregoing way, they take the whole stomach out of the flayed bull, leaving the entrails and the fat in the carcass, and cut off the legs, the end of the loin, the shoulders, and the neck.
<milestone n="3" unit="section" />Having done this, they fill what remains of the carcass with pure bread, honey, raisins, figs, frankincense, myrrh, and other kinds of incense, and then burn it, pouring a lot of oil on it.
<milestone n="4" unit="section" />They fast before the sacrifice, and while it is burning, they all make lamentation; and when their lamentation is over, they set out a meal of what is left of the victim.

<milestone n="41" unit="chapter" /><milestone n="1" unit="section" />

<milestone n="4" unit="section" />Cattle that die are dealt with in the following way.

<milestone n="6" unit="section" />But one day a year, at the festival of <name type="pers">Zeus</name>, they cut in pieces and flay a single ram and put the fleece on the image of <name type="pers">Zeus</name>, as in the story; then they bring an image of <name type="pers">Heracles</name> near it.

<milestone n="44" unit="chapter" /><milestone n="1" unit="section" />
<milestone unit="para" />Moreover, wishing to get clear information about this matter where it was possible so to do, I took ship for <name key="tgn,7002862" type="place" reg=" +Tyre [35.183,33.266] (inhabited place), Al-Janub, Lebanon, Asia "><placeName key="tgn,7002862" authname="tgn,7002862">Tyre</placeName></name> in <name key="tgn,6004687" type="place" reg=" +Phoenicia (region (general)), Asia "><placeName key="tgn,6004687" authname="tgn,6004687">Phoenicia</placeName></name>, where I had learned by inquiry that there was a holy temple of <name type="pers">Heracles</name>.<note anchored="yes" resp="ed" place="unspecified">The <name type="ethnic">Tyrian</name> god <name type="pers">Melkart</name>.</note>
<milestone n="2" unit="section" />There I saw it, richly equipped with many other offerings, besides two pillars, one of refined gold, one of emerald: a great pillar that shone at night; and in conversation with the priests, I asked how long it was since their temple was built.
<milestone n="3" unit="section" />I found that their account did not tally with the belief of the <name type="ethnic">Greeks</name>, either; for they said that the temple of the god was founded when <name key="tgn,7002862" type="place" reg="Tyre [35.183,33.266] (inhabited place), Al-Janub, Lebanon, Asia"><placeName key="tgn,7002862" authname="tgn,7002862">Tyre</placeName></name> first became a city, and that was two thousand three hundred years ago.

<milestone n="4" unit="section" />Then I went to <name key="tgn,7011070" type="place" reg="Thasos (island), Kavalla, Macedonia, Greece, Europe"><placeName key="tgn,7011070" authname="tgn,7011070">Thasos</placeName></name>, too, where I found a temple of <name type="pers">Heracles</name> built by the <name type="ethnic">Phoenicians</name>, who made a settlement there when they voyaged in search of <name key="tgn,1000003" type="place" reg="Europe (continent)"><placeName key="tgn,1000003" authname="tgn,1000003">Europe</placeName></name>; now they did so as much as five generations before the birth of <name type="pers">Heracles</name> the son of <name type="pers">Amphitryon</name> in <name key="tgn,1000074" type="place" reg="Greece [22,39] (nation), Europe"><placeName key="tgn,1000074" authname="tgn,1000074">Hellas</placeName></name>.
<milestone n="5" unit="section" />Therefore, what I have discovered by inquiry plainly shows that <name type="pers">Heracles</name> is an ancient god. And furthermore, those <name type="ethnic">Greeks</name>, I think, are most in the right, who have established and practise two worships of <name type="pers">Heracles</name>, sacrificing to one <name type="pers">Heracles</name> as to an immortal, and calling him the <name type="ethnic">Olympian</name>, but to the other bringing offerings as to a dead hero<note anchored="yes" resp="ed" place="unspecified">There is a dual <name type="pers">Heracles</name> in the <title>Odyssey</title>, <bibl n="Hom.

<milestone unit="para" />And the <name type="ethnic">Greeks</name> say many other ill-considered things, too; among them, this is a silly story which they tell about <name type="pers">Heracles</name>: that when he came to <name key="tgn,7016833" type="place" reg="Egypt [30,27] (nation), Africa "><placeName key="tgn,7016833" authname="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName></name>, the <name type="ethnic">Egyptians</name> crowned him and led him out in a procession to sacrifice him to <name type="pers">Zeus</name>; and for a while (they say) he followed quietly, but when they started in on him at the altar, he resisted and killed them all.
<milestone n="2" unit="section" />Now it seems to me that by this story the <name type="ethnic">Greeks</name> show themselves altogether ignorant of the character and customs of the <name type="ethnic">Egyptians</name>; for how should they sacrifice men when they are forbidden to sacrifice even beasts, except swine and bulls and bull-calves, if they are unblemished, and geese?
<milestone n="3" unit="section" />And furthermore, as <name type="pers">Heracles</name> was alone, and, still, only a man, as they say, how is it natural that he should kill many myriads? In talking so much about this, may I keep the goodwill of gods and heroes!

<milestone n="46" unit="chapter" /><milestone n="1" unit="section" />
<milestone unit="para" />This is why the <name type="ethnic">Egyptians</name> of whom I have spoken sacrifice no goats, male or female: the <name type="ethnic">Mendesians</name> reckon Pan among the eight gods who, they say, were before the twelve gods.
<milestone n="2" unit="section" />Now in their painting and sculpture, the image of Pan is made with the head and the legs of a goat, as among the <name type="ethnic">Greeks</name>; not that he is thought to be in fact such, or unlike other gods; but why they represent him so, I have no wish to say.
<milestone n="3" unit="section" />The <name type="ethnic">Mendesians</name> consider all goats sacred, the male even more than the female, and goatherds are held in special estimation: one he-goat is most sacred of all; when he dies, it is ordained that there should be great mourning in all the <name type="place">Mendesian district</name>.
<milestone n="4" unit="section" />In the <name type="ethnic">Egyptian</name> language <name type="pers">Mendes</name> is the name both for the he-goat and for <name type="pers">Pan</name>. In my lifetime a strange thing occurred in this district: a he-goat had intercourse openly with a woman. This came to be publicly known.

<milestone n="47" unit="chapter" /><milestone n="1" unit="section" />
<milestone unit="para" />Swine are held by the <name type="ethnic">Egyptians</name> to be unclean beasts. In the first place, if an <name type="ethnic">Egyptian</name> touches a hog in passing, he goes to the river and dips himself in it, clothed as he is; and in the second place, swineherds, though native born <name type="ethnic">Egyptians</name>, are alone of all men forbidden to enter any <name type="ethnic">Egyptian</name> temple; nor will any give a swineherd his daughter in marriage, nor take a wife from their women; but swineherds intermarry among themselves.
<milestone n="2" unit="section" />Nor do the <name type="ethnic">Egyptians</name> think it right to sacrifice swine to any god except the Moon and <name type="pers">Dionysus</name>; to these, they sacrifice their swine at the same time, in the same season of full moon; then they eat the meat. The <name type="ethnic">Egyptians</name> have an explanation of why they sacrifice swine at this festival, yet abominate them at others; I know it, but it is not fitting that I relate it.
<milestone n="3" unit="section" />But this is how they sacrifice swine to the Moon: the sacrificer lays the end of the tail and the spleen and the caul together and covers them up with all the fat that he finds around the belly, then consigns it all to the fire; as for the rest of the flesh, they eat it at the time of full moon when they sacrifice the victim; but they will not taste it on any other day. Poor men, with but slender means, mold swine out of dough, which they then take and sacrifice.

<milestone n="48" unit="chapter" /><milestone n="1" unit="section" />
<milestone unit="para" />To <name type="pers">Dionysus</name>, on the evening of his festival, everyone offers a piglet which he kills before his door and then gives to the swineherd who has sold it, for him to take away.
<milestone n="2" unit="section" />The rest of the festival of <name type="pers">Dionysus</name> is observed by the <name type="ethnic">Egyptians</name> much as it is by the <name type="ethnic">Greeks</name>, except for the dances; but in place of the phallus, they have invented the use of puppets two feet high moved by strings, the male member nodding and nearly as big as the rest of the body, which are carried about the villages by women; a flute-player goes ahead, the women follow behind singing of <name type="pers">Dionysus</name>.
<milestone n="3" unit="section" />Why the male member is so large and is the only part of the body that moves, there is a sacred legend that explains.

<milestone n="49" unit="chapter" /><milestone n="1" unit="section" />
<milestone unit="para" />Now then, it seems to me that <name type="pers">Melampus</name> son of <name type="pers">Amytheon</name> was not ignorant of but was familiar with this sacrifice. For <name type="pers">Melampus</name> was the one who taught the <name type="ethnic">Greeks</name> the name of <name type="pers">Dionysus</name> and the way of sacrificing to him and the phallic procession; he did not exactly unveil the subject taking all its details into consideration, for the teachers who came after him made a fuller revelation; but it was from him that the <name type="ethnic">Greeks</name> learned to bear the phallus along in honor of <name type="pers">Dionysus</name>, and they got their present practice from his teaching.
<milestone n="2" unit="section" />I say, then, that <name type="pers">Melampus</name> acquired the prophetic art, being a discerning man, and that, besides many other things which he learned from <name key="tgn,7016833" type="place" reg="Egypt [30,27] (nation), Africa "><placeName key="tgn,7016833" authname="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName></name>, he also taught the <name type="ethnic">Greeks</name> things concerning <name type="pers">Dionysus</name>, altering few of them; for I will not say that what is done in <name key="tgn,7016833" type="place" reg="Egypt [30,27] (nation), Africa "><placeName key="tgn,7016833" authname="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName></name> in connection with the god and what is done among the <name type="ethnic">Greeks</name> originated independently: for they would then be of an <name type="ethnic">Hellenic</name> character and not recently introduced.
<milestone n="3" unit="section" />Nor again will I say that the <name type="ethnic">Egyptians</name> took either this or any other custom from the <name type="ethnic">Greeks</name>.

<milestone n="3" unit="section" />Alone of all nations the <name type="ethnic">Libyans</name> have had among them the name of <name type="pers">Poseidon</name> from the beginning, and they have always honored this god.

<milestone n="51" unit="chapter" /><milestone n="1" unit="section" />
<milestone unit="para" />These customs, then, and others besides, which I shall indicate, were taken by the <name type="ethnic">Greeks</name> from the <name type="ethnic">Egyptians</name>.

<milestone n="4" unit="section" />The <name type="ethnic">Athenians</name>, then, were the first <name type="ethnic">Greeks</name> to make ithyphallic images of <name type="pers">Hermes</name>, and they did this because the <name type="ethnic">Pelasgians</name> taught them.

<milestone n="52" unit="chapter" /><milestone n="1" unit="section" />
<milestone unit="para" />Formerly, in all their sacrifices, the <name type="ethnic">Pelasgians</name> called upon gods without giving name or appellation to any (I know this, because I was told at <name key="perseus,Dodona" type="place" reg="Dodona [20.8,39.55] (Perseus)"><placeName key="perseus,Dodona" authname="perseus,Dodona">Dodona</placeName></name>); for as yet they had not heard of such.

for I suppose <name type="pers">Hesiod</name> and Homer flourished not more than four hundred years earlier than I; and these are the ones who taught the <name type="ethnic">Greeks</name> the descent of the gods, and gave the gods their names, and determined their spheres and functions, and described their outward forms.
<milestone n="3" unit="section" />But the poets who are said to have been earlier than these men were, in my opinion, later.

and then, being a slave there, she established a shrine of <name type="pers">Zeus</name> under an oak that was growing there; for it was reasonable that, as she had been a handmaid of the temple of <name type="pers">Zeus</name> at <name key="tgn,7001297" type="place" reg="Thebes [32.666,25.683] (deserted settlement), Qina, Upper Egypt, Egypt, Africa"><placeName key="tgn,7001297" authname="tgn,7001297">Thebes</placeName></name>

<name type="ethnic">Egyptians</name> who do not come to this are mindful on the night of sacrifice to keep their own lamps burning, and so they are alight not only at <name type="place">Saïs</name> but throughout <name key="tgn,7016833" type="place" reg="Egypt [30,27] (nation), Africa "><placeName key="tgn,7016833" authname="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName></name>.

At <name type="place">Papremis</name> sacrifice is offered and rites performed just as elsewhere; but when the sun is setting, a few of the priests hover about the image, while most of them go and stand in the entrance to the temple with clubs of wood in their hands; others, more than a thousand men fulfilling vows, who also carry wooden clubs, stand in a mass opposite.
<milestone n="2" unit="section" />The image of the god, in a little gilded wooden shrine, they carry away on the day before this to another sacred building. The few who are left with the image draw a four-wheeled wagon conveying the shrine and the image that is in the shrine; the others stand in the space before the doors and do not let them enter, while the vow-keepers, taking the side of the god, strike them, who defend themselves.
<milestone n="3" unit="section" />A fierce fight with clubs breaks out there, and they are hit on their heads, and many, I expect, even die from their wounds; although the <name type="ethnic">Egyptians</name> said that nobody dies.
<milestone n="4" unit="section" />The natives say that they made this assembly a custom from the following incident: the mother of <name type="pers">Ares</name> lived in this temple; <name type="pers">Ares</name> had been raised apart from her and came, when he grew up, wishing to visit his mother; but as her attendants kept him out and would not let him pass, never having seen him before, <name type="pers">Ares</name> brought men from another town, manhandled the attendants, and went in to his mother.

<milestone unit="para" />Furthermore, it was the <name type="ethnic">Egyptians</name> who first made it a matter of religious observance not to have intercourse with women in temples or to enter a temple after such intercourse without washing. Nearly all other peoples are less careful in this matter than are the <name type="ethnic">Egyptians</name> and <name type="ethnic">Greeks</name>, and consider a man to be like any other animal;
<milestone n="2" unit="section" />
for beasts and birds (they say) are seen to mate both in the temples and in the sacred precincts; now were this displeasing to the god, the beasts would not do so. This is the reason given by others for practices which I, for my part, dislike;

<milestone n="65" unit="chapter" /><milestone n="1" unit="section" />
but the <name type="ethnic">Egyptians</name> in this and in all other matters are exceedingly strict against desecration of their temples.

All of them are held sacred; some of these are part of men's households and some not; but if I were to say why they are left alone as sacred, I should end up talking of matters of divinity, which I am especially averse to treating; I have never touched upon such except where necessity has compelled me.
<milestone n="3" unit="section" />But I will indicate how it is customary to deal with the animals. Men and women are appointed guardians to provide nourishment for each kind respectively; a son inherits this office from his father.
<milestone n="4" unit="section" />Townsfolk in each place, when they pay their vows, pray to the god to whom the animal is dedicated, shaving all or one half or one third of their children's heads, and weighing the hair in a balance against a sum of silver; then the weight in silver of the hair is given to the female guardian of the creatures, who buys fish with it and feeds them.
<milestone n="5" unit="section" />Thus, food is provided for them. Whoever kills one of these creatures intentionally is punished with death; if he kills accidentally, he pays whatever penalty the priests appoint. Whoever kills an ibis or a hawk, intentionally or not, must die for it.

<milestone n="66" unit="chapter" /><milestone n="1" unit="section" />
<milestone unit="para" />There are many household animals; and there would be many more, were it not for what happens among the cats. When the females have a litter, they are no longer receptive to the males; those that seek to have intercourse with them cannot;
<milestone n="2" unit="section" />
so their recourse is to steal and carry off and kill the kittens (but they do not eat what they have killed). The mothers, deprived of their young and desiring to have more, will then approach the males; for they are creatures that love offspring.
<milestone n="3" unit="section" />And when a fire breaks out, very strange things happen among the cats. The <name type="ethnic">Egyptians</name> stand around in a broken line, thinking more of the cats than of quenching the burning; but the cats slip through or leap over the men and spring into the fire.

It has four feet, and lives both on land and in the water, for it lays eggs and hatches them out on land and spends the greater part of the day on dry ground, and the night in the river, the water being warmer than the air and dew.
<milestone n="2" unit="section" />No mortal creature of all which we know grows from so small a beginning to such greatness; for its eggs are not much bigger than goose eggs, and the young crocodile is of a proportional size, but it grows to a length of twenty-eight feet and more.
<milestone n="3" unit="section" />It has eyes like pigs' eyes, and long, protruding teeth. It is the only animal that has no tongue. It does not move the lower jaw, but brings the upper jaw down upon the lower, uniquely among beasts.
<milestone n="4" unit="section" />It also has strong claws, and a scaly, impenetrable hide on its back. It is blind in the water, but very keen of sight in the air. Since it lives in the water, its mouth is all full of leeches. All birds and beasts flee from it, except the sandpiper<note anchored="yes" resp="ed" place="unspecified"><name type="ethnic">Egyptian</name> spur-winged lapwing (Hoplopterus armatus).</note> , with which it is at peace because this bird does the crocodile a service;
<milestone n="5" unit="section" />
for whenever the crocodile comes ashore out of the water and then opens its mouth (and it does this mostly to catch the west wind), the sandpiper goes into its mouth and eats the leeches; the crocodile is pleased by this service and does the sandpiper no harm.

<milestone unit="para" />There are many different ways of crocodile hunting; I will write of the way that I think most worth mentioning. The hunter baits a hook with a hog's back, and lets it float into the midst of the river; he himself stays on the bank with a young live pig, which he beats.
<milestone n="2" unit="section" />Hearing the squeals of the pig, the crocodile goes after the sound, and meets the bait, which it swallows; then the hunters pull the line.

<milestone n="4" unit="section" />This is how he conveys him: he first molds an egg of myrrh as heavy as he can carry, then tries lifting it, and when he has tried it, he then hollows out the egg and puts his father into it, and plasters over with more myrrh the hollow of the egg into which he has put his father, which is the same in weight with his father lying in it, and he conveys him encased to the temple of the Sun in <name key="tgn,7016833" type="place" reg="Egypt [30,27] (nation), Africa "><placeName key="tgn,7016833" authname="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName></name>.

When I arrived there, I saw innumerable bones and backbones of serpents: many heaps of backbones, great and small and even smaller.
<milestone n="2" unit="section" />This place, where the backbones lay scattered, is where a narrow mountain pass opens into a great plain, which adjoins the plain of <name key="tgn,7016833" type="place" reg="Egypt [30,27] (nation), Africa "><placeName key="tgn,7016833" authname="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName></name>.

<milestone n="4" unit="section" />The <name type="ethnic">Arabians</name> say that the ibis is greatly honored by the <name type="ethnic">Egyptians</name> for this service, and the <name type="ethnic">Egyptians</name> give the same reason for honoring these birds.

<milestone n="76" unit="chapter" /><milestone n="1" unit="section" />
<milestone unit="para" />Now this is the appearance of the ibis. It is all quite black, with the legs of a crane, and a beak sharply hooked, and is as big as a landrail. Such is the appearance of the ibis which fights with the serpents. Those that most associate with men (for there are two kinds of ibis<note anchored="yes" resp="ed" place="unspecified">Geronticus Calvus and Ibis Aethiopica.</note> )
<milestone n="2" unit="section" />
have the whole head and neck bare of feathers; their plumage is white, except the head and neck and wingtips and tail (these being quite black); the legs and beak of the bird are like those of the other ibis. The serpents are like water-snakes.
<milestone n="3" unit="section" />Their wings are not feathered but very like the wings of a bat.<milestone unit="para" />I have now said enough concerning creatures that are sacred.

<milestone n="77" unit="chapter" /><milestone n="1" unit="section" />
<milestone unit="para" />Among the <name type="ethnic">Egyptians</name> themselves, those who live in the cultivated country are the most assiduous of all men at preserving the memory of the past, and none whom I have questioned are so skilled in history.
<milestone n="2" unit="section" />They practice the following way of life. For three consecutive days in every month they purge themselves, pursuing health by means of emetics and drenches; for they think that it is from the food they eat that all sicknesses come to men.
<milestone n="3" unit="section" />Even without this, the <name type="ethnic">Egyptians</name> are the healthiest of all men, next to the <name type="ethnic">Libyans</name>; the explanation of which, in my opinion, is that the climate in all seasons is the same: for change is the great cause of men's falling sick, more especially changes of seasons.
<milestone n="4" unit="section" />They eat bread, making loaves which they call “cyllestis,”<note anchored="yes" resp="ed" place="unspecified">Loaves twisted to a point, apparently.</note> of coarse grain. For wine, they use a drink made from barley, for they have no vines in their country. They eat fish either raw and sun-dried, or preserved with brine.
<milestone n="5" unit="section" />Quails and ducks and small birds are salted and eaten raw; all other kinds of birds, as well as fish (except those that the <name type="ethnic">Egyptians</name> consider sacred) are eaten roasted or boiled.

<milestone unit="para" />After rich men's repasts, a man carries around an image in a coffin, painted and carved in exact imitation of a corpse two or four feet long. This he shows to each of the company, saying “While you drink and enjoy, look on this; for to this state you must come when you die.” Such is the custom at their symposia.

<milestone n="79" unit="chapter" /><milestone n="1" unit="section" />
<milestone unit="para" />They keep the customs of their fathers, adding none to them. Among other notable customs of theirs is this, that they have one song, the Linus-song,<note anchored="yes" resp="ed" place="unspecified">This is the hymn for a slain youth (said to typify the departure of early summer), <name type="pers">Thammuz</name>, <name type="pers">Atys</name>, <name type="pers">Hylas</name>, or <name type="pers">Linus</name>; the <name type="ethnic">Semitic</name> refrain ai lenu, “alas for us,” becomes the <name type="ethnic">Greek</name> <foreign lang="greek">αἴλινος</foreign>, from which comes the name <name type="pers">Linus</name>.</note> which is sung in <name key="tgn,6004687" type="place" reg=" +Phoenicia (region (general)), Asia "><placeName key="tgn,6004687" authname="tgn,6004687">Phoenicia</placeName></name> and <name key="tgn,1006894" type="place" reg="Cyprus [33,35] (island), Asia"><placeName key="tgn,1006894" authname="tgn,1006894">Cyprus</placeName></name> and elsewhere; each nation has a name of its own for this,
<milestone n="2" unit="section" />
but it happens to be the same song that the <name type="ethnic">Greeks</name> sing, and call <name type="pers">Linus</name>; so that of many things in <name key="tgn,7016833" type="place" reg="Egypt [30,27] (nation), Africa "><placeName key="tgn,7016833" authname="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName></name> that amaze me, one is: where did the <name type="ethnic">Egyptians</name> get <name type="pers">Linus</name>? Plainly they have always sung this song; but in Egyptian <name type="pers">Linus</name> is called <name type="pers">Maneros</name>.<note anchored="yes" resp="ed" place="unspecified"><name type="pers">Maneros</name>, probably from the refrain ma-n-hra, “come back to us.”</note>
<milestone n="3" unit="section" />The <name type="ethnic">Egyptians</name> told me that <name type="pers">Maneros</name> was the only son of their first king, who died prematurely, and this dirge was sung by the <name type="ethnic">Egyptians</name> in his honor; and this, they said, was their earliest and their only chant.

<milestone n="80" unit="chapter" /><milestone n="1" unit="section" />
<milestone unit="para" />There is a custom, too, which no <name type="ethnic">Greeks</name> except the <name type="ethnic">Lacedaemonians</name> have in common with the <name type="ethnic">Egyptians</name>: younger men, encountering their elders, yield the way and stand aside, and rise from their seats for them when they approach.
<milestone n="2" unit="section" />But they are like none of the <name type="ethnic">Greeks</name> in this: passers-by do not address each other, but salute by lowering the hand to the knee.

<milestone n="81" unit="chapter" /><milestone n="1" unit="section" />
<milestone unit="para" />They wear linen tunics with fringes hanging about the legs, called “calasiris,” and loose white woolen mantles over these. But nothing woolen is brought into temples, or buried with them: that is impious.
<milestone n="2" unit="section" />They agree in this with practices called Orphic and Bacchic, but in fact <name type="ethnic">Egyptian</name> and Pythagorean: for it is impious, too, for one partaking of these rites to be buried in woolen wrappings. There is a sacred legend about this.

<milestone n="82" unit="chapter" /><milestone n="1" unit="section" />
<milestone unit="para" />Other things originating with the <name type="ethnic">Egyptians</name> are these. Each month and day belong to one of the gods, and according to the day of one's birth are determined how one will fare and how one will end and what one will be like; those <name type="ethnic">Greeks</name> occupied with poetry exploit this.
<milestone n="2" unit="section" />More portents have been discovered by them than by all other peoples; when a portent occurs, they take note of the outcome and write it down; and if something of a like kind happens again, they think it will have a like result.

<milestone n="83" unit="chapter" /><milestone n="1" unit="section" />
<milestone unit="para" />As to the art of divination among them, it belongs to no man, but to some of the gods; there are in their country oracles of <name type="pers">Heracles</name>, <name type="pers">Apollo</name>, <name type="pers">Athena</name>, <name type="pers">Artemis</name>, <name type="pers">Ares</name>, and <name type="pers">Zeus</name>, and of <name type="pers">Leto</name> (the most honored of all) in the town of <name key="tgn,7001292" type="place" reg=" +Kawm al-Farain [30.733,31.2] (deserted settlement), Kafr ash-Shaykh, Lower Egypt, Egypt, Africa "><placeName key="tgn,7001292" authname="tgn,7001292">Buto</placeName></name>. Nevertheless, they have several ways of divination, not just one.

<milestone n="84" unit="chapter" /><milestone n="1" unit="section" />
<milestone unit="para" />The practice of medicine is so specialized among them that each physician is a healer of one disease and no more. All the country is full of physicians, some of the eye, some of the teeth, some of what pertains to the belly, and some of internal diseases.

<milestone n="85" unit="chapter" /><milestone n="1" unit="section" />
<milestone unit="para" />They mourn and bury the dead like this: whenever a man of note is lost to his house by death, all the women of the house daub their faces or heads with mud; then they leave the corpse in the house and roam about the city lamenting, with their garments girt around them and their breasts showing, and with them all the women of their relatives;
<milestone n="2" unit="section" />
elsewhere, the men lament, with garments girt likewise. When this is done, they take the dead body to be embalmed.

<milestone n="86" unit="chapter" /><milestone n="1" unit="section" />
<milestone unit="para" />There are men whose sole business this is and who have this special craft.
<milestone n="2" unit="section" />When a dead body is brought to them, they show those who brought it wooden models of corpses, painted likenesses; the most perfect way of embalming belongs, they say, to One whose name it would be impious for me to mention in treating such a matter; the second way, which they show, is less perfect than the first, and cheaper; and the third is the least costly of all. Having shown these, they ask those who brought the body in which way they desire to have it prepared.
<milestone n="3" unit="section" />Having agreed on a price, the bearers go away, and the workmen, left alone in their place, embalm the body. If they do this in the most perfect way, they first draw out part of the brain through the nostrils with an iron hook, and inject certain drugs into the rest.
<milestone n="4" unit="section" />Then, making a cut near the flank with a sharp knife of <name type="pers">Ethiopian</name> stone, they take out all the intestines, and clean the belly, rinsing it with palm wine and bruised spices;
<milestone n="5" unit="section" />
they sew it up again after filling the belly with pure ground myrrh and casia and any other spices, except frankincense. After doing this, they conceal the body for seventy days, embalmed in saltpetre; no longer time is allowed for the embalming;
<milestone n="6" unit="section" />
and when the seventy days have passed, they wash the body and wrap the whole of it in bandages of fine linen cloth, anointed with gum, which the <name type="ethnic">Egyptians</name> mostly use instead of glue;
<milestone n="7" unit="section" />
then they give the dead man back to his friends. These make a hollow wooden figure like a man, in which they enclose the corpse, shut it up, and keep it safe in a coffin-chamber, placed erect against a wall.

<milestone n="87" unit="chapter" /><milestone n="1" unit="section" />
<milestone unit="para" />That is how they prepare the dead in the most costly way;<note anchored="yes" resp="ed" place="unspecified"><foreign lang="greek">τοὺς τὰ πολυτελέστατα,</foreign> sc. <foreign lang="greek">βουλομένους.</foreign></note> those who want the middle way and shun the costly, they prepare as follows.
<milestone n="2" unit="section" />The embalmers charge their syringes with cedar oil and fill the belly of the dead man with it, without making a cut or removing the intestines, but injecting the fluid through the anus and preventing it from running out; then they embalm the body for the appointed days; on the last day they drain the belly of the cedar oil which they put in before.
<milestone n="3" unit="section" />It has such great power as to bring out with it the internal organs and intestines all dissolved; meanwhile, the flesh is eaten away by the saltpetre, and in the end nothing is left of the body but hide and bones. Then the embalmers give back the dead body with no more ado.

<milestone n="88" unit="chapter" /><milestone n="1" unit="section" />
<milestone unit="para" />The third manner of embalming, the preparation of the poorer dead, is this: they cleanse the belly with a purge, embalm the body for the seventy days and then give it back to be taken away.

<milestone n="89" unit="chapter" /><milestone n="1" unit="section" />
<milestone unit="para" />Wives of notable men, and women of great beauty and reputation, are not at once given to the embalmers, but only after they have been dead for three or four days;
<milestone n="2" unit="section" />
this is done to deter the embalmers from having intercourse with the women. For it is said that one was caught having intercourse with the fresh corpse of a woman, and was denounced by his fellow-workman.

<milestone n="90" unit="chapter" /><milestone n="1" unit="section" />
<milestone unit="para" />Anyone, <name type="ethnic">Egyptian</name> or foreigner, known to have been carried off by a crocodile or drowned by the river itself, must by all means be embalmed and wrapped as attractively as possible and buried in a sacred coffin by the people of the place where he is cast ashore;
<milestone n="2" unit="section" />
none of his relatives or friends may touch him, but his body is considered something more than human, and is handled and buried by the priests of the <name key="tgn,1127805" type="place" reg="Nahr an- Nil [31.1,30.166] (river), Africa"><placeName key="tgn,1127805" authname="tgn,1127805">Nile</placeName></name> themselves.

<milestone unit="para" />The <name type="ethnic">Egyptians</name> shun using <name type="ethnic">Greek</name> customs, and (generally speaking) the customs of all other peoples as well.

<milestone n="2" unit="section" />In this city is a square temple of <name type="pers">Perseus</name> son of <name type="pers">Danae</name>, in a grove of palm trees. Before this temple stand great stone columns; and at the entrance, two great stone statues. In the outer court there is a shrine with an image of <name type="pers">Perseus</name> standing in it.
<milestone n="3" unit="section" />The people of this <name key="tgn,7001190" type="place" reg=" +Akhmim [31.733,26.566] (inhabited place), Sawhaj, Upper Egypt, Egypt, Africa "><placeName key="tgn,7001190" authname="tgn,7001190">Khemmis</placeName></name> say that <name type="pers">Perseus</name> is seen often up and down this land, and often within the temple, and that the sandal he wears, which is four feet long, keeps turning up, and that when it does turn up, all <name key="tgn,7016833" type="place" reg="Egypt [30,27] (nation), Africa "><placeName key="tgn,7016833" authname="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName></name> prospers.
<milestone n="4" unit="section" />This is what they say; and their doings in honor of <name type="pers">Perseus</name> are <name type="ethnic">Greek</name>, inasmuch as they celebrate games that include every form of contest, and offer animals and cloaks and skins as prizes.
<milestone n="5" unit="section" />When I asked why <name type="pers">Perseus</name> appeared only to them, and why, unlike all other <name type="ethnic">Egyptians</name>, they celebrate games, they told me that <name type="pers">Perseus</name> was by lineage of their city; for <name type="pers">Danaus</name> and <name type="pers">Lynceus</name>, who travelled to <name key="tgn,1000074" type="place" reg="Greece [22,39] (nation), Europe"><placeName key="tgn,1000074" authname="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName></name>, were of <name key="tgn,7001190" type="place" reg=" +Akhmim [31.733,26.566] (inhabited place), Sawhaj, Upper Egypt, Egypt, Africa "><placeName key="tgn,7001190" authname="tgn,7001190">Khemmis</placeName></name>; and they traced descent from these down to <name type="pers">Perseus</name>.
<milestone n="6" unit="section" />They told how he came to <name key="tgn,7001190" type="place" reg=" +Akhmim [31.733,26.566] (inhabited place), Sawhaj, Upper Egypt, Egypt, Africa "><placeName key="tgn,7001190" authname="tgn,7001190">Khemmis</placeName></name>, too, when he came to <name key="tgn,7016833" type="place" reg="Egypt [30,27] (nation), Africa "><placeName key="tgn,7016833" authname="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName></name> for the reason alleged by the <name type="ethnic">Greeks</name> as well—namely, to bring the <name type="pers">Gorgon</name>'s head from <name key="tgn,1000172" type="place" reg="Libya [17,25] (nation), Africa"><placeName key="tgn,1000172" authname="tgn,1000172">Libya</placeName></name>—and recognized all his relatives; and how he had heard the name of <name key="tgn,7001190" type="place" reg=" +Akhmim [31.733,26.566] (inhabited place), Sawhaj, Upper Egypt, Egypt, Africa "><placeName key="tgn,7001190" authname="tgn,7001190">Khemmis</placeName></name> from his mother before he came to <name key="tgn,7016833" type="place" reg="Egypt [30,27] (nation), Africa "><placeName key="tgn,7016833" authname="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName></name>. It was at his bidding, they said, that they celebrated the games.

<milestone n="92" unit="chapter" /><milestone n="1" unit="section" />
<milestone unit="para" />All these are the customs of <name type="ethnic">Egyptians</name> who live above the marsh country. Those who inhabit the marshes have the same customs as the rest of <name type="ethnic">Egyptians</name>, even that each man has one wife just like <name type="ethnic">Greeks</name>. They have, besides, devised means to make their food less costly.
<milestone n="2" unit="section" />When the river is in flood and flows over the plains, many lilies, which the <name type="ethnic">Egyptians</name> call lotus, grow in the water. They gather these and dry them in the sun; then they crush the poppy-like center of the plant and bake loaves of it.
<milestone n="3" unit="section" />The root of this lotus is edible also, and of a sweetish taste; it is round, and the size of an apple.
<milestone n="4" unit="section" />Other lilies grow in the river, too, that are like roses; the fruit of these is found in a calyx springing from the root by a separate stalk, and is most like a comb made by wasps; this produces many edible seeds as big as olive pits, which are eaten both fresh and dried.
<milestone n="5" unit="section" />They also use the byblus which grows annually: it is gathered from the marshes, the top of it cut off and put to other uses, and the lower part, about twenty inches long, eaten or sold. Those who wish to use the byblus at its very best, roast it before eating in a red-hot oven. Some live on fish alone. They catch the fish, take out the intestines, then dry them in the sun and eat them dried.

<milestone n="93" unit="chapter" /><milestone n="1" unit="section" />
<milestone unit="para" />Fish that go in schools are seldom born in rivers; they are raised in the lakes, and this is how they behave: when the desire of spawning comes on them, they swim out to sea in schools, the males leading, and throwing out their milt, while the females come after and swallow and conceive from it.
<milestone n="2" unit="section" />When the females have grown heavy in the sea, then all the fish swim back to their own haunts. But the same no longer lead; now the leadership goes to the females. They go before in a school as the males had, and now and then throw off some of their eggs (which are like millet-seeds), which the males devour as they follow. These millet-seeds, or eggs, are fish.
<milestone n="3" unit="section" />The fish that are reared come from the eggs that survive and are not devoured. Those fish that are caught while swimming seawards show bruises on the left side of their heads; those that are caught returning, on the right side.
<milestone n="4" unit="section" />This happens because they keep close to the left bank as they swim seawards, and keep to the same bank also on their return, grazing it and keeping in contact with it as well as they can, I suppose lest the current make them miss their way.
<milestone n="5" unit="section" />When the <name key="tgn,1127805" type="place" reg="Nahr an- Nil [31.1,30.166] (river), Africa"><placeName key="tgn,1127805" authname="tgn,1127805">Nile</placeName></name> begins to rise, hollow and marshy places near the river are the first to begin to fill, the water trickling through from the river, and as soon as they are flooded, they are suddenly full of little fishes.
<milestone n="6" unit="section" />Where these probably come from, I believe that I can guess. When the <name key="tgn,1127805" type="place" reg="Nahr an- Nil [31.1,30.166] (river), Africa"><placeName key="tgn,1127805" authname="tgn,1127805">Nile</placeName></name> falls, the fish have dropped their eggs into the mud before they leave with the last of the water; and when in the course of time the flood comes again in the following year, from these eggs at once come the fish.

<milestone n="94" unit="chapter" /><milestone n="1" unit="section" />
<milestone unit="para" />So much, then, for the fish. The <name type="ethnic">Egyptians</name> who live around the marshes use an oil drawn from the castor-berry, which they call kiki. They sow this plant, which grows wild in <name key="tgn,1000074" type="place" reg="Greece [22,39] (nation), Europe"><placeName key="tgn,1000074" authname="tgn,1000074">Hellas</placeName></name>, on the banks of the rivers and lakes;

This is thick and useful as oil for lamps, and gives off a strong smell.

those living about the marshes have a different recourse, instead of the towers. Every one of them has a net, with which he catches fish by day, and at night he sets it around the bed where he rests, then creeps under it and sleeps.

they have a raft made of tamarisk wood, fastened together with matting of reeds, and a pierced stone of about two talents' weight; the raft is let go to float down ahead of the boat, connected to it by a rope, and the stone is connected by a rope to the after part of the boat.
<milestone n="5" unit="section" />So, driven by the current, the raft floats swiftly and tows the “baris” (which is the name of these boats,) and the stone dragging behind on the river bottom keeps the boat's course straight. There are many of these boats; some are of many thousand talents' burden.

<milestone unit="para" />So far, all I have said is the record of my own autopsy and judgment and inquiry. Henceforth I will record <name type="ethnic">Egyptian</name> chronicles, according to what I have heard, adding something of what I myself have seen.
<milestone n="2" unit="section" />The priests told me that <name type="pers">Min</name> was the first king of <name key="tgn,7016833" type="place" reg="Egypt [30,27] (nation), Africa "><placeName key="tgn,7016833" authname="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName></name>, and that first he separated <name key="tgn,7001186" type="place" reg="Mit Rahina [31.25,29.85] (inhabited place), Giza, Upper Egypt, Egypt, Africa"><placeName key="tgn,7001186" authname="tgn,7001186">Memphis</placeName></name> from the <name key="tgn,1127805" type="place" reg="Nahr an- Nil [31.1,30.166] (river), Africa"><placeName key="tgn,1127805" authname="tgn,1127805">Nile</placeName></name> by a dam. All the river had flowed close under the sandy mountains on the <name type="ethnic">Libyan</name> side, but <name type="pers">Min</name> made the southern bend of it, which begins about twelve and one half miles above <name key="tgn,7001186" type="place" reg="Mit Rahina [31.25,29.85] (inhabited place), Giza, Upper Egypt, Egypt, Africa"><placeName key="tgn,7001186" authname="tgn,7001186">Memphis</placeName></name>, by damming the stream, thereby drying up the ancient channel, and carried the river by a channel so that it flowed midway between the hills.
<milestone n="3" unit="section" />And to this day the <name type="ethnic">Persians</name> keep careful watch on this bend of the river, strengthening its dam every year to keep the current in; for were the <name key="tgn,1127805" type="place" reg="Nahr an- Nil [31.1,30.166] (river), Africa"><placeName key="tgn,1127805" authname="tgn,1127805">Nile</placeName></name> to burst its dikes and overflow here, all <name key="tgn,7001186" type="place" reg="Mit Rahina [31.25,29.85] (inhabited place), Giza, Upper Egypt, Egypt, Africa"><placeName key="tgn,7001186" authname="tgn,7001186">Memphis</placeName></name> would be in danger of flooding.
<milestone n="4" unit="section" />Then, when this first king <name type="pers">Min</name> had made dry land of what he thus cut off, he first founded in it that city which is now called <name key="tgn,7001186" type="place" reg="Mit Rahina [31.25,29.85] (inhabited place), Giza, Upper Egypt, Egypt, Africa"><placeName key="tgn,7001186" authname="tgn,7001186">Memphis</placeName></name> (for even <name key="tgn,7001186" type="place" reg="Mit Rahina [31.25,29.85] (inhabited place), Giza, Upper Egypt, Egypt, Africa"><placeName key="tgn,7001186" authname="tgn,7001186">Memphis</placeName></name> lies in the narrow part of <name key="tgn,7016833" type="place" reg="Egypt [30,27] (nation), Africa "><placeName key="tgn,7016833" authname="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName></name>), and outside of it he dug a lake from the river to its north and west (for the <name key="tgn,1127805" type="place" reg="Nahr an- Nil [31.1,30.166] (river), Africa"><placeName key="tgn,1127805" authname="tgn,1127805">Nile</placeName></name> itself bounds it on the east); and secondly, he built in it the great and most noteworthy temple of <name type="pers">Hephaestus</name>.

<milestone n="100" unit="chapter" /><milestone n="1" unit="section" />
<milestone unit="para" />After him came three hundred and thirty kings, whose names the priests recited from a papyrus roll. In all these many generations there were eighteen <name type="pers">Ethiopian</name> kings, and one queen, native to the country; the rest were all <name type="ethnic">Egyptian</name> men.
<milestone n="2" unit="section" />The name of the queen was the same as that of the <name type="ethnic">Babylonian</name> princess, <name type="pers">Nitocris</name>. She, to avenge her brother (he was king of <name key="tgn,7016833" type="place" reg="Egypt [30,27] (nation), Africa "><placeName key="tgn,7016833" authname="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName></name> and was slain by his subjects, who then gave <name type="pers">Nitocris</name> the sovereignty) put many of the <name type="ethnic">Egyptians</name> to death by treachery.
<milestone n="3" unit="section" />She built a spacious underground chamber; then, with the pretence of inaugurating it, but with quite another intent in her mind, she gave a great feast, inviting to it those <name type="ethnic">Egyptians</name> whom she knew to have had the most complicity in her brother's murder; and while they feasted, she let the river in upon them by a vast secret channel.
<milestone n="4" unit="section" />This was all that the priests told of her, except that when she had done this she cast herself into a chamber full of hot ashes, to escape vengeance.

<milestone n="101" unit="chapter" /><milestone n="1" unit="section" />
<milestone unit="para" />But of the other kings they related no achievement or act of great note, except of <name type="pers">Moeris</name>, the last of them.
<milestone n="2" unit="section" />This <name type="pers">Moeris</name> was remembered as having built the northern forecourt of the temple of <name type="pers">Hephaestus</name>, and dug a lake, of as great a circumference as I shall later indicate; and built pyramids there also, the size of which I will mention when I speak of the lake. All this was <name type="pers">Moeris</name>' work, they said; of none of the rest had they anything to record.

<milestone n="102" unit="chapter" /><milestone n="1" unit="section" />
<milestone unit="para" />Leaving the latter aside, then, I shall speak of the king who came after them, whose name was <name type="pers">Sesostris</name><note anchored="yes" resp="ed" place="unspecified"><name type="pers">Rameses II</name>., called by the <name type="ethnic">Greeks</name> <name type="pers">Sesostris</name>; said to have ruled in the fourteenth century B.C.</note>.
<milestone n="2" unit="section" />This king, the priests said, set out with a fleet of long ships<note anchored="yes" resp="ed" place="unspecified">Ships of war.</note> from the <name key="tgn,7016761" type="place" reg="Persian Gulf [53.83,25.583] (gulf), Asia"><placeName key="tgn,7016761" authname="tgn,7016761">Arabian Gulf</placeName></name> and subjugated all those living by the <name key="tgn,7016791" type="place" reg=" +Red Sea [42,15] (sea) "><placeName key="tgn,7016791" authname="tgn,7016791">Red Sea</placeName></name>, until he came to a sea which was too shallow for his vessels.
<milestone n="3" unit="section" />After returning from there back to <name key="tgn,7016833" type="place" reg="Egypt [30,27] (nation), Africa "><placeName key="tgn,7016833" authname="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName></name>, he gathered a great army (according to the account of the priests) and marched over the mainland, subjugating every nation to which he came.
<milestone n="4" unit="section" />When those that he met were valiant men and strove hard for freedom, he set up pillars in their land, the inscription on which showed his own name and his country's, and how he had overcome them with his own power;
<milestone n="5" unit="section" />
but when the cities had made no resistance and been easily taken, then he put an inscription on the pillars just as he had done where the nations were brave; but he also drew on them the private parts of a woman, wishing to show clearly that the people were cowardly.

<milestone n="103" unit="chapter" /><milestone n="1" unit="section" />
<milestone unit="para" />He marched over the country doing this until he had crossed over from <name key="tgn,1000004" type="place" reg="Asia (continent)"><placeName key="tgn,1000004" authname="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName></name> to <name key="tgn,1000003" type="place" reg="Europe (continent)"><placeName key="tgn,1000003" authname="tgn,1000003">Europe</placeName></name> and defeated the <name type="ethnic">Scythians</name> and <name type="ethnic">Thracians</name>. Thus far and no farther, I think, the <name type="ethnic">Egyptian</name> army went; for the pillars can be seen standing in their country, but in none beyond it.
<milestone n="2" unit="section" />From there, he turned around and went back home; and when he came to the <name type="place"><placeName key="tgn,7012263" authname="tgn,7012263">Phasis</placeName> river</name>, that King, <name type="pers">Sesostris</name>, may have detached some part of his army and left it there to live in the country (for I cannot speak with exact knowledge), or it may be that some of his soldiers grew weary of his wanderings, and stayed by the <name key="tgn,7012263" type="place" reg=" +Poti [41.683,42.183] (inhabited place), regions under republican jurisdiction, Georgia, Asia ">Phasis</name>.

<milestone n="2" unit="section" />
the <name type="ethnic">Egyptians</name> said that they considered the <name type="ethnic">Colchians</name> part of <name type="pers">Sesostris</name>' army. I myself guessed it, partly because they are dark-skinned and woolly-haired; though that indeed counts for nothing, since other peoples are, too; but my better proof was that the <name type="ethnic">Colchians</name> and <name type="ethnic">Egyptians</name> and <name type="ethnic">Ethiopians</name> are the only nations that have from the first practised circumcision.

<milestone n="4" unit="section" />But as to the <name type="ethnic">Egyptians</name> and <name type="ethnic">Ethiopians</name> themselves, I cannot say which nation learned it from the other; for it is evidently a very ancient custom.

<milestone n="2" unit="section" />It was these who dragged the great and long blocks of stone which were brought in this king's reign to the temple of <name type="pers">Hephaestus</name>; and it was they who were compelled to dig all the canals which are now in <name key="tgn,7016833" type="place" reg="Egypt [30,27] (nation), Africa "><placeName key="tgn,7016833" authname="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName></name>, and involuntarily made what had been a land of horses and carts empty of these.

<milestone n="2" unit="section" />
then, it is said, the king was so audacious as to seize a spear and hurl it into the midst of the river eddies. Right after this, he came down with a disease of the eyes, and became blind. When he had been blind for ten years, an oracle from the city of <name key="tgn,7001292" type="place" reg=" +Kawm al-Farain [30.733,31.2] (deserted settlement), Kafr ash-Shaykh, Lower Egypt, Egypt, Africa "><placeName key="tgn,7001292" authname="tgn,7001292">Buto</placeName></name> declared to him that the term of his punishment was drawing to an end, and that he would regain his sight by washing his eyes with the urine of a woman who had never had intercourse with any man but her own husband.
<milestone n="3" unit="section" />
<name type="pers">Pheros</name> tried his own wife first; and, as he remained blind, all women, one after another. When he at last recovered his sight, he took all the women whom he had tried, except the one who had made him see again, and gathered them into one town, the one which is now called “<name type="place">Red Clay</name>”; having concentrated them together there, he burnt them and the town;
<milestone n="4" unit="section" />
but the woman by whose means he had recovered his sight, he married. Most worthy of mention among the many offerings which he dedicated in all the noteworthy temples for his deliverance from blindness are the two marvellous stone obelisks which he set up in the temple of the Sun. Each of these is made of a single block, and is over one hundred and sixty-six feet high and thirteen feet thick.

<milestone n="120" unit="chapter" /><milestone n="1" unit="section" />
<milestone unit="para" />The <name type="ethnic">Egyptians</name>' priests said this, and I myself believe their story about <name type="pers">Helen</name>, for I reason thus: had <name type="pers">Helen</name> been in <name key="tgn,7002329" type="place" reg=" +Troy [26.25,39.95] (deserted settlement), Canakkale, Marmara, Turkey, Asia "><placeName key="tgn,7002329" authname="tgn,7002329">Ilion</placeName></name>, then with or without the will of <name type="pers">Alexandrus</name> she would have been given back to the <name type="ethnic">Greeks</name>.

<name type="pers">Alexandrus</name> was not even heir to the throne, in which case matters might have been in his hands since <name type="pers">Priam</name> was old, but <name type="pers">Hector</name>, who was an older and a better man than <name type="pers">Alexandrus</name>, was going to receive the royal power at <name type="pers">Priam</name>'s death, and ought not have acquiesced in his brother's wrongdoing, especially when that brother was the cause of great calamity to <name type="pers">Hector</name> himself and all the rest of the <name type="ethnic">Trojans</name>.
<milestone n="5" unit="section" />But since they did not have <name type="pers">Helen</name> there to give back, and since the <name type="ethnic">Greeks</name> would not believe them although they spoke the truth—I am convinced and declare—the divine powers provided that the <name type="ethnic">Trojans</name>, perishing in utter destruction, should make this clear to all mankind: that retribution from the gods for terrible wrongdoing is also terrible.

<milestone n="2" unit="section" />So when the chamber was finished, the king stored his treasure in it, and as time went on, the builder, drawing near the end of his life, summoned his sons (he had two) and told them how he had provided for them, that they have an ample livelihood, by the art with which he had built the king's treasure-house; explaining clearly to them how to remove the stone, he gave the coordinates of it, and told them that if they kept these in mind, they would be the custodians of the king's riches.
<milestone n="3" unit="section" />So when he was dead, his sons got to work at once: coming to the palace by night, they readily found and managed the stone in the building, and took away much of the treasure.

<milestone n="121B" unit="chapter" /><milestone n="1" unit="section" />When the king opened the building, he was amazed to see the containers lacking their treasure; yet he did not know whom to accuse, seeing that the seals were unbroken and the building shut fast. But when less treasure appeared the second and third times he opened the building (for the thieves did not stop plundering), he had traps made and placed around the containers in which his riches were stored.
<milestone n="2" unit="section" />The thieves came just as before, and one of them crept in; when he came near the container, right away he was caught in the trap. When he saw the trouble he was in, he called to his brother right away and explained to him the problem, and told him to come in quickly and cut off his head, lest he be seen and recognized and destroy him, too. He seemed to have spoken rightly to the other, who did as he was persuaded and then, replacing the stone, went home, carrying his brother's head.

<milestone n="121C" unit="chapter" /><milestone n="1" unit="section" />When day came, the king went to the building, and was amazed to see in the trap the thief's body without a head, yet the building intact, with no way in or out. At a loss, he did as follows: he suspended the thief's body from the wall and set guards over it, instructing them to seize and bring to him any whom they saw weeping or making lamentation.
<milestone n="2" unit="section" />
<milestone unit="para" />But the thief's mother, when the body had been hung up, was terribly stricken: she had words with her surviving son, and told him that he was somehow to think of some way to cut loose and bring her his brother's body, and if he did not obey, she threatened to go to the king and denounce him as having the treasure.

<milestone n="121D" unit="chapter" /><milestone n="1" unit="section" />So when his mother bitterly reproached the surviving son and for all that he said he could not dissuade her, he devised a plan: he harnessed asses and put skins full of wine on the asses, then set out driving them; and when he was near those who were guarding the hanging body, he pulled at the feet of two or three of the skins and loosed their fastenings;
<milestone n="2" unit="section" />
and as the wine ran out, he beat his head and cried aloud like one who did not know to which ass he should turn first, while the guards, when they saw the wine flowing freely, ran out into the road with cups and caught what was pouring out, thinking themselves in luck;
<milestone n="3" unit="section" />
feigning anger, the man cursed all; but as the guards addressed him peaceably, he pretended to be soothed and to relent in his anger, and finally drove his asses out of the road and put his harness in order.
<milestone n="4" unit="section" />And after more words passed and one joked with him and got him to laugh, he gave them one of the skins: and they lay down there just as they were, disposed to drink, and included him and told him to stay and drink with them; and he consented and stayed.
<milestone n="5" unit="section" />When they cheerily saluted him in their drinking, he gave them yet another of the skins; and the guards grew very drunk with the abundance of liquor, and lay down right there where they were drinking, overpowered by sleep;
<milestone n="6" unit="section" />
but he, when it was late at night, cut down the body of his brother and shaved the right cheek of each of the guards for the indignity, and loading the body on his asses, drove home, fulfilling his mother's commands.

<milestone n="121E" unit="chapter" /><milestone n="1" unit="section" />
<milestone unit="para" />When the king learned that the body of the thief had been taken, he was beside himself and, obsessed with finding who it was who had managed this, did as follows—they say, but I do not believe it.
<milestone n="2" unit="section" />He put his own daughter in a brothel, instructing her to accept all alike and, before having intercourse, to make each tell her the shrewdest and most impious thing he had done in his life; whoever told her the story of the thief, she was to seize and not let get out.
<milestone n="3" unit="section" />The girl did as her father told her, and the thief, learning why she was doing this, did as follows, wanting to get the better of the king by craft.
<milestone n="4" unit="section" />He cut the arm off a fresh corpse at the shoulder, and went to the king's daughter, carrying it under his cloak, and when asked the same question as the rest, he said that his most impious act had been when he had cut the head off his brother who was caught in a trap in the king's treasury; and his shrewdest, that after making the guards drunk he had cut down his brother's hanging body.
<milestone n="5" unit="section" />When she heard this, the princess grabbed for him; but in the darkness the thief let her have the arm of the corpse; and clutching it, she held on, believing that she had the arm of the other; but the thief, after giving it to her, was gone in a flash out the door.

<milestone n="121F" unit="chapter" /><milestone n="1" unit="section" />
<milestone unit="para" />When this also came to the king's ears, he was astonished at the man's ingenuity and daring, and in the end, he sent a proclamation to every town, promising the thief immunity and a great reward if he would come into the king's presence.
<milestone n="2" unit="section" />The thief trusted the king and came before him; <name type="pers">Rhampsinitus</name> was very admiring and gave him his daughter to marry on the grounds that he was the cleverest of men; for as the <name type="ethnic">Egyptians</name> (he said) surpassed all others in craft, so he surpassed the <name type="ethnic">Egyptians</name>.

<milestone n="3" unit="section" />There are <name type="ethnic">Greeks</name> who have used this doctrine, some earlier and some later, as if it were their own; I know their names, but do not record them.

<milestone n="2" unit="section" />To some, he assigned the task of dragging stones from the quarries in the <name type="place">Arabian mountains</name> to the <name key="tgn,1127805" type="place" reg="Nahr an- Nil [31.1,30.166] (river), Africa"><placeName key="tgn,1127805" authname="tgn,1127805">Nile</placeName></name>; and after the stones were ferried across the river in boats, he organized others to receive and drag them to the mountains called <name type="ethnic">Libyan</name>.
<milestone n="3" unit="section" />They worked in gangs of a hundred thousand men, each gang for three months. For ten years the people wore themselves out building the road over which the stones were dragged, work which was in my opinion not much lighter at all than the building of the pyramid<note anchored="yes" resp="ed" place="unspecified">The “<name type="place">Great Pyramid</name>.”</note>
<milestone n="4" unit="section" />
(for the road is nearly a mile long and twenty yards wide, and elevated at its highest to a height of sixteen yards, and it is all of stone polished and carved with figures). The aforesaid ten years went to the building of this road and of the underground chambers in the hill where the pyramids stand; these, the king meant to be burial-places for himself, and surrounded them with water, bringing in a channel from the <name key="tgn,1127805" type="place" reg="Nahr an- Nil [31.1,30.166] (river), Africa"><placeName key="tgn,1127805" authname="tgn,1127805">Nile</placeName></name>.
<milestone n="5" unit="section" />The pyramid itself was twenty years in the making. Its base is square, each side eight hundred feet long, and its height is the same; the whole is of stone polished and most exactly fitted; there is no block of less than thirty feet in length.

<milestone n="125" unit="chapter" /><milestone n="1" unit="section" />
<milestone unit="para" />This pyramid was made like stairs, which some call steps and others, tiers.
<milestone n="2" unit="section" />When this, its first form, was completed, the workmen used short wooden logs as levers to raise the rest of the stones<note anchored="yes" resp="ed" place="unspecified">That is, the stones which were to fill up the angles of the steps, and make the side of the pyramid a smooth inclined plane.

<milestone n="3" unit="section" />
when the stone had been raised, it was set on another lever that stood on the first tier, and the lever again used to lift it from this tier to the next.
<milestone n="4" unit="section" />It may be that there was a new lever on each tier of steps, or perhaps there was only one lever, quite portable, which they carried up to each tier in turn; I leave this uncertain, as both possibilities were mentioned.
<milestone n="5" unit="section" />But this is certain, that the upper part of the pyramid was finished off first, then the next below it, and last of all the base and the lowest part.
<milestone n="6" unit="section" />There are writings on<note anchored="yes" resp="ed" place="unspecified">Or, “in.”</note> the pyramid in <name type="ethnic">Egyptian</name> characters indicating how much was spent on radishes and onions and garlic for the workmen; and I am sure that, when he read me the writing, the interpreter said that sixteen hundred talents of silver had been paid.
<milestone n="7" unit="section" />Now if that is so, how much must have been spent on the iron with which they worked, and the workmen's food and clothing, considering that the time aforesaid was spent in building, while hewing and carrying the stone and digging out the underground parts was, as I suppose, a business of long duration.

<milestone n="126" unit="chapter" /><milestone n="1" unit="section" />
<milestone unit="para" />And so evil a man was <name type="pers">Kheops</name> that, needing money, he put his own daughter in a brothel and made her charge a fee (how much, they did not say). She did as her father told her, but was disposed to leave a memorial of her own, and asked of each coming to her that he give one stone;
<milestone n="2" unit="section" />
and of these stones they said the pyramid was built that stands midmost of the three, over against the great pyramid; each side of it measures one hundred and fifty feet.

<milestone n="127" unit="chapter" /><milestone n="1" unit="section" />
<milestone unit="para" />The <name type="ethnic">Egyptians</name> said that this <name type="pers">Kheops</name> reigned for fifty years; at his death he was succeeded by his brother <name type="pers">Khephren</name>, who was in all respects like <name type="pers">Kheops</name>. <name type="pers">Khephren</name> also built a pyramid, smaller than his brother's.

<milestone n="2" unit="section" />It has no underground chambers, nor is it entered like the other by a canal from the <name key="tgn,1127805" type="place" reg="Nahr an- Nil [31.1,30.166] (river), Africa"><placeName key="tgn,1127805" authname="tgn,1127805">Nile</placeName></name>, but the river comes in through a built passage and encircles an island, in which, they say, <name type="pers">Kheops</name> himself lies.
<milestone n="3" unit="section" />This pyramid was built on the same scale as the other, except that it falls forty feet short of it in height; it stands near the great pyramid; the lowest layer of it is of variegated <name type="pers">Ethiopian</name> stone.

Disliking his father's doings, he opened the temples and let the people, ground down to the depth of misery, go to their business and their sacrifices; and he was the most just judge among all the kings.

<milestone n="3" unit="section" />Though mild toward his people and conducting himself as he did, yet he suffered calamities, the first of which was the death of his daughter, the only child of his household. Deeply grieved over this misfortune, he wanted to give her a burial somewhat more sumptuous than ordinary; he therefore made a hollow cow's image of gilded wood and placed the body of his dead daughter therein.

<milestone n="130" unit="chapter" /><milestone n="1" unit="section" />
<milestone unit="para" />This cow was not buried in the earth but was to be seen even in my time, in the town of <name type="place">Saïs</name>, where it stood in a furnished room of the palace; incense of all kinds is offered daily before it, and a lamp burns by it all through every night.
<milestone n="2" unit="section" />Near this cow in another chamber statues of <name type="pers">Mycerinus</name>' concubines stand, so the priests of <name type="place">Saïs</name> said; and in fact there are about twenty colossal wooden figures there, made like naked women; but except what I was told, I cannot tell who these are.

<milestone n="131" unit="chapter" /><milestone n="1" unit="section" />

and they say that afterwards the girl strangled herself for grief, and that he buried her in this cow, but that her mother cut off the hands of the attendants who had betrayed the daughter to her father, and that now their statues are in the same condition as the living women were.
<milestone n="3" unit="section" />But this I believe to be a silly story, especially about the hands of the figures. For in fact we ourselves saw that the hands have fallen off through age, and were lying at their feet even in my day.

<milestone n="132" unit="chapter" /><milestone n="1" unit="section" />
<milestone unit="para" />As for the cow, it is covered with a purple robe, only the head and neck exposed, encrusted with a very thick layer of gold. Between the horns is the golden figure of the sun's orb.
<milestone n="2" unit="section" />It does not stand, but kneels; it is as big as a live cow of great size. This image is carried out of the chamber once every year, whenever the <name type="ethnic">Egyptians</name> mourn the god whose name I omit in speaking of these matters:
<milestone n="3" unit="section" />
then the cow is brought out into the light; for they say that before she died she asked her father, <name type="pers">Mycerinus</name>, that she see the sun once a year<note anchored="yes" resp="ed" place="unspecified">The cow-worship is no doubt the cult of <name type="pers">Isis</name>, honored at <name type="place">Saïs</name> under the name <name type="pers">Nit</name>.</note>.

<milestone n="2" unit="section" />The king took this badly, and sent back to the oracle a message of reproach, blaming the god that his father and his uncle, though they had shut up the temples, and disregarded the gods, and destroyed men, had lived for a long time, but that he who was pious was going to die so soon.
<milestone n="3" unit="section" />But a second oracle came announcing that for this very reason his life was hastening to a close: he had done what was contrary to fate; <name key="tgn,7016833" type="place" reg="Egypt [30,27] (nation), Africa "><placeName key="tgn,7016833" authname="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName></name> should have been afflicted for a hundred and fifty years, and the two kings before him knew this, but not he.
<milestone n="4" unit="section" />Hearing this, <name type="pers">Mycerinus</name> knew that his doom was fixed.

<milestone n="5" unit="section" />This was his recourse, so that by turning night into day he might make his six years into twelve and so prove the oracle false.

<milestone n="134" unit="chapter" /><milestone n="1" unit="section" />
<milestone unit="para" />This king, too, left a pyramid, but far smaller than his father's, each side twenty feet short of three hundred feet long, square at the base, and as much as half its height of <name type="pers">Ethiopian</name> stone.

indeed, it is clear to me that they say this without even knowing who <name type="pers">Rhodopis</name> was (otherwise, they would never have credited her with the building of a pyramid on which what I may call an uncountable sum of money was spent), or that <name type="pers">Rhodopis</name> flourished in the reign of <name type="pers">Amasis</name>, not of <name type="pers">Mycerinus</name>;

<milestone n="2" unit="section" />As not much money was in circulation during this king's reign, they told me, a law was made for the <name type="ethnic">Egyptians</name> allowing a man to borrow on the security of his father's corpse; and the law also provided that the lender become master of the entire burial-vault of the borrower, and that the penalty for one giving this security, should he fail to repay the loan, was that he was not to be buried at his death either in that tomb of his fathers or in any other, nor was he to bury any relative of his there.

“Do not think me less than pyramids of stone; for I excel them as much as <name type="pers">Zeus</name> does other gods; for they stuck a pole down into a marsh and collected what mud clung to the pole, made bricks of it, and thus built me.” These were the acts of <name type="pers">Asukhis</name>.

<milestone n="2" unit="section" />Seeing this vision, he said, he supposed it to be a manifestation sent to him by the gods, so that he might commit sacrilege and so be punished by gods or men; he would not (he said) do so, but otherwise, for the time foretold for his rule over <name key="tgn,7016833" type="place" reg="Egypt [30,27] (nation), Africa "><placeName key="tgn,7016833" authname="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName></name> was now fulfilled, after which he was to depart:

<milestone n="2" unit="section" />This island was never discovered before the time of <name type="pers">Amyrtaeus</name>; all the kings before him sought it in vain for more than seven hundred years.

<milestone n="3" unit="section" />The priest, in this quandary, went into the temple shrine and there before the god's image bitterly lamented over what he expected to suffer. Sleep came on him while he was lamenting, and it seemed to him the god stood over him and told him to take heart, that he would come to no harm encountering the power of <name key="tgn,1012700" type="place" reg="Arabian Peninsula [45,25] (region (general)), Asia"><placeName key="tgn,1012700" authname="tgn,1012700">Arabia</placeName></name>: “I shall send you champions,” said the god.

<milestone unit="para" />Thus far went the record given by the <name type="ethnic">Egyptians</name> and their priests; and they showed me that the time from the first king to that priest of <name type="pers">Hephaestus</name>, who was the last, covered three hundred and forty-one generations, and that in this time this also had been the number of their kings, and of their high priests.
<milestone n="2" unit="section" />Now three hundred generations are ten thousand years, three generations being equal to a hundred. And over and above the three hundred, the remaining forty-one cover thirteen hundred and forty years.
<milestone n="3" unit="section" />Thus the whole period is eleven thousand three hundred and forty years; in all of which time (they said) they had had no king who was a god in human form, nor had there been any such either before or after those years among the rest of the kings of <name key="tgn,7016833" type="place" reg="Egypt [30,27] (nation), Africa "><placeName key="tgn,7016833" authname="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName></name>.

, where he made a genealogy for himself that had him descended from a god in the sixteenth generation. But the priests of <name type="pers">Zeus</name> did with him as they also did with me (who had not traced my own lineage).
<milestone n="2" unit="section" />They brought me into the great inner court of the temple and showed me wooden figures there which they counted to the total they had already given, for every high priest sets up a statue of himself there during his lifetime;
<milestone n="3" unit="section" />
pointing to these and counting, the priests showed me that each succeeded his father; they went through the whole line of figures, back to the earliest from that of the man who had most recently died.
<milestone n="4" unit="section" />Thus, when <name type="pers">Hecataeus</name> had traced his descent and claimed that his sixteenth forefather was a god, the priests too traced a line of descent according to the method of their counting; for they would not be persuaded by him that a man could be descended from a god; they traced descent through the whole line of three hundred and forty-five figures, not connecting it with any ancestral god or hero, but declaring each figure to be a “Piromis” the son of a “Piromis”; in <name type="ethnic">Greek</name>, one who is in all respects a good man.

<milestone n="144" unit="chapter" /><milestone n="1" unit="section" />
<milestone unit="para" />Thus they showed that all those whose statues stood there had been good men, but quite unlike gods.

<milestone n="2" unit="section" />How many years there were between <name type="pers">Heracles</name> and the reign of <name type="pers">Amasis</name>, I have already shown; Pan is said to be earlier still; the years between <name type="pers">Dionysus</name> and <name type="pers">Amasis</name> are the fewest, and they are reckoned by the <name type="ethnic">Egyptians</name> at fifteen thousand.
<milestone n="3" unit="section" />The <name type="ethnic">Egyptians</name> claim to be sure of all this, since they have reckoned the years and chronicled them in writing.
<milestone n="4" unit="section" />Now the <name type="pers">Dionysus</name> who was called the son of <name type="pers">Semele</name>, daughter of <name type="pers">Cadmus</name>, was about sixteen hundred years before my time, and <name type="pers">Heracles</name> son of <name type="pers">Alcmene</name> about nine hundred years; and Pan the son of <name type="pers">Penelope</name> (for according to the <name type="ethnic">Greeks</name> <name type="pers">Penelope</name> and <name type="pers">Hermes</name> were the parents of Pan) was about eight hundred years before me, and thus of a later date than the <name type="ethnic">Trojan</name> war.

<milestone n="146" unit="chapter" /><milestone n="1" unit="section" />
<milestone unit="para" />With regard to these two, Pan and <name type="pers">Dionysus</name>, one may follow whatever story one thinks most credible; but I give my own opinion concerning them here.

<milestone n="2" unit="section" />
but as it is, the <name type="ethnic">Greek</name> story has it that no sooner was <name type="pers">Dionysus</name> born than <name type="pers">Zeus</name> sewed him up in his thigh and carried him away to <name key="perseus,Nysa" type="place" reg=" +Nysa [28.1667,37.8667] (Perseus) "><placeName key="perseus,Nysa" authname="perseus,Nysa">Nysa</placeName></name> in <name key="tgn,7000489" type="place" reg="Ethiopia [39,8] (nation), Africa"><placeName key="tgn,7000489" authname="tgn,7000489">Ethiopia</placeName></name> beyond <name key="tgn,7016833" type="place" reg="Egypt [30,27] (nation), Africa "><placeName key="tgn,7016833" authname="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName></name>; and as for Pan, the <name type="ethnic">Greeks</name> do not know what became of him after his birth. It is therefore plain to me that the <name type="ethnic">Greeks</name> learned the names of these two gods later than the names of all the others, and trace the birth of both to the time when they gained the knowledge.

<milestone n="147" unit="chapter" /><milestone n="1" unit="section" />

<milestone unit="para" />After the reign of the priest of <name type="pers">Hephaestus</name> the <name type="ethnic">Egyptians</name> were made free.

<milestone n="3" unit="section" />These kings intermarried, and agreed to be close friends, no one deposing another or seeking to possess more than another.
<milestone n="4" unit="section" />The reason for this agreement, which they scrupulously kept, was this: no sooner were they established in their districts than an oracle was given them that whichever of them poured a libation from a bronze vessel in the temple of <name type="pers">Hephaestus</name> (where, as in all the temples, they used to assemble) would be king of all <name key="tgn,7016833" type="place" reg="Egypt [30,27] (nation), Africa "><placeName key="tgn,7016833" authname="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName></name>.

<milestone n="148" unit="chapter" /><milestone n="1" unit="section" />
<milestone unit="para" />Moreover, they decided to preserve the memory of their names by a common memorial, and so they made a labyrinth<note anchored="yes" resp="ed" place="unspecified">This “labyrinth” was a horseshoe-shaped group of buildings, supposed to have been near the pyramid of <name key="tgn,5004210" type="place" reg="Hawara [30.9,29.266] (ruins), Al-Fayyum, Upper Egypt, Egypt, Africa"><placeName key="tgn,5004210" authname="tgn,5004210">Hawara</placeName></name> (<name type="pers">Sayce</name>).</note> a little way beyond <name key="tgn,1118985" type="place" reg="Birkat Qarun [30.666,29.466] (salt lake), Egypt, Africa"><placeName key="tgn,1118985" authname="tgn,1118985">lake Moeris</placeName></name> and near the place called the <name key="tgn,7000991" type="place" reg="Kiman Faris [30.833,29.316] (deserted settlement), Al-Fayyum, Upper Egypt, Egypt, Africa"><placeName key="tgn,7000991" authname="tgn,7000991">City of Crocodiles</placeName></name>.

<milestone n="2" unit="section" />
if one were to collect the walls and evidence of other efforts of the <name type="ethnic">Greeks</name>, the sum would not amount to the labor and cost of this labyrinth.

<milestone n="3" unit="section" />Though the pyramids beggar description and each one of them is a match for many great monuments built by <name type="ethnic">Greeks</name>, this maze surpasses even the pyramids.
<milestone n="4" unit="section" />It has twelve roofed courts with doors facing each other: six face north and six south, in two continuous lines, all within one outer wall. There are also double sets of chambers, three thousand altogether, fifteen hundred above and the same number under ground.
<milestone n="5" unit="section" />We ourselves viewed those that are above ground, and speak of what we have seen, but we learned through conversation about the underground chambers;

<milestone n="6" unit="section" />Thus we can only speak from hearsay of the lower chambers; the upper we saw for ourselves, and they are creations greater than human. The exits of the chambers and the mazy passages hither and thither through the courts were an unending marvel to us as we passed from court to apartment and from apartment to colonnade, from colonnades again to more chambers and then into yet more courts.
<milestone n="7" unit="section" />Over all this is a roof, made of stone like the walls, and the walls are covered with cut figures, and every court is set around with pillars of white stone very precisely fitted together. Near the corner where the labyrinth ends stands a pyramid two hundred and forty feet high, on which great figures are cut. A passage to this has been made underground.

<milestone n="149" unit="chapter" /><milestone n="1" unit="section" />
<milestone unit="para" />Such is this labyrinth; and still more marvellous is <name key="tgn,1118985" type="place" reg="Birkat Qarun [30.666,29.466] (salt lake), Egypt, Africa"><placeName key="tgn,1118985" authname="tgn,1118985">lake Moeris</placeName></name>, on which it stands. This lake has a circumference of four hundred and fifty miles, or sixty schoeni: as much as the whole seaboard of <name key="tgn,7016833" type="place" reg="Egypt [30,27] (nation), Africa "><placeName key="tgn,7016833" authname="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName></name>. Its length is from north to south; the deepest part has a depth of fifty fathoms.
<milestone n="2" unit="section" />That it has been dug out and made by men's hands the lake shows for itself; for almost in the middle of it stand two pyramids, so built that fifty fathoms of each are below and fifty above the water; atop each is a colossal stone figure seated on a throne.
<milestone n="3" unit="section" />Thus these pyramids are a hundred fathoms high; and a hundred fathoms equal a furlong of six hundred feet, the fathom measuring six feet or four cubits, the foot four spans and the cubit six spans.
<milestone n="4" unit="section" />The water of the lake is not natural (for the country here is exceedingly arid) but brought by a channel from the <name key="tgn,1127805" type="place" reg="Nahr an- Nil [31.1,30.166] (river), Africa"><placeName key="tgn,1127805" authname="tgn,1127805">Nile</placeName></name>; six months it flows into the lake, and six back into the river.
<milestone n="5" unit="section" />For the six months that it flows out of the lake, the daily take of fish brings a silver talent into the royal treasury, and twenty minae for each day of the flow into the lake.

<milestone n="2" unit="section" />When I could not see anywhere the earth taken from the digging of this lake, since this was curious to me, I asked those who live nearest the lake where the stuff was that had been dug out. They told me where it had been carried, and I readily believed them, for I had heard of a similar thing happening in the <name type="ethnic">Assyrian</name> city of <name key="tgn,7017998" type="place" reg="Nineveh (deserted settlement), Ninawa, Iraq, Asia "><placeName key="tgn,7017998" authname="tgn,7017998">Ninus</placeName></name>.

Some thieves plotted to carry it off; they surveyed their course and dug an underground way from their own house to the palace, carrying the earth taken out of the passage dug by night to the <name key="tgn,1130850" type="place" reg="Tigris [47.416,31] (river), Asia"><placeName key="tgn,1130850" authname="tgn,1130850">Tigris</placeName></name>, which runs past <name key="tgn,7017998" type="place" reg="Nineveh (deserted settlement), Ninawa, Iraq, Asia "><placeName key="tgn,7017998" authname="tgn,7017998">Ninus</placeName></name>, until at last they accomplished their end.
<milestone n="4" unit="section" />This, I was told, had happened when the <name type="place">Egyptian lake</name> was dug, except that the work went on not by night but by day.

<milestone n="2" unit="section" />
<name type="pers">Apries</name>, they say, supposed that not even a god could depose him from his throne, so firmly did he think he was established; and now, defeated in battle and taken captive, he was brought to <name type="place">Saïs</name>, to the royal dwelling which belonged to him once but now belonged to <name type="pers">Amasis</name>.

<milestone n="2" unit="section" />Now at first he was scorned and held in low regard by the <name type="ethnic">Egyptians</name> on the ground that he was a common man and of no high family; but presently he won them over by being shrewd and not arrogant.
<milestone n="3" unit="section" />He had among his countless treasures a golden washbowl, in which he and all those who ate with him were accustomed to clean their feet. This he broke in pieces and out of it made a god's image, which he set in a most conspicuous spot in the city; and the <name type="ethnic">Egyptians</name> came frequently to this image and held it in great reverence.
<milestone n="4" unit="section" />When <name type="pers">Amasis</name> learned what the townsfolk were doing, he called the <name type="ethnic">Egyptians</name> together and told them that the image had been made out of the washbowl, in which <name type="ethnic">Egyptians</name> had once vomited and urinated and cleaned their feet, but which now they greatly revered.
<milestone n="5" unit="section" />
“Now then,” he said, “I have fared like the washbowl, since if before I was a common man, still, I am your king now.” And he told them to honor and show respect for him.

<milestone n="173" unit="chapter" /><milestone n="1" unit="section" />
<milestone unit="para" />The following was how he scheduled his affairs: in the morning, until the the hour when the marketplace filled, he readily conducted whatever business was brought to him; the rest of the day, he drank and joked at the expense of his companions and was idle and playful.
<milestone n="2" unit="section" />But this displeased his friends, who admonished him thus: “O King, you do not conduct yourself well by indulging too much in vulgarity. You, a celebrated man, ought to conduct your business throughout the day, sitting on a celebrated throne; and thus the <name type="ethnic">Egyptians</name> would know that they are governed by a great man, and you would be better spoken of; as it is, what you do is by no means kingly.”
<milestone n="3" unit="section" />But he answered them like this: “Men that have bows string them when they must use them, and unstring them when they have used them; were bows kept strung forever, they would break, and so could not be used when needed.
<milestone n="4" unit="section" />Such, too, is the nature of man. Were one to be always at serious work and not permit oneself a bit of relaxation, he would go mad or idiotic before he knew it; I am well aware of that, and give each of the two its turn.” Such was his answer to his friends.

<milestone unit="para" />It is said that even when <name type="pers">Amasis</name> was a private man he was fond of drinking and joking and was not at all a sober man; and that when his drinking and pleasure-seeking cost him the bare necessities, he would go around stealing.

<milestone n="2" unit="section" />When he became king, he did not take care of the shrines of the gods who had acquitted him of theft, or give them anything for maintenance, or make it his practice to sacrifice there, for he knew them to be worthless and their oracles false; but he took scrupulous care of the gods who had declared his guilt, considering them to be gods in very deed and their oracles infallible.

it was not dragged within (so they say) because while it was being drawn the chief builder complained aloud of the great expense of time and his loathing of the work, and <name type="pers">Amasis</name> taking this to heart would not let it be drawn further.
