A statically-generated toggle interlinear based off an arbitrary verse of the SBLGNT edition of MorphGNT.

Written by James Tauber and originally based on a prototype from 2006 described in blog post: <http://jktauber.com/2006/01/28/dynamic-interlinears-javascript-and-css/>

Run `./generate.py` to generate the interlinear for John 3.16 (or edit the script for other verses).
