New prototype for building plain, hover, toggle, and frequency-based interlinears for an arbitrary verse using a Berean interlinear CSV file.

Written by James Tauber and originally based on a prototype from 2006 described in blog post: <http://jktauber.com/2006/01/28/dynamic-interlinears-javascript-and-css/>

`berean_tables.csv` needs to be downloaded from <http://berean.bible> (not able to freely redistribute) and put in `data` directory.

Once you have that, run `./generate.py` to generate the four interlinears for John 3.16 (or edit the script for other verses).
