# DeepReader

DeepReader is a Vue.js-based online reading environment designed for deep reading of texts with integrated learning tools.

It is particulary intended for the study of classical languages such as Ancient Greek but could be applied to any texts with rich annotations.

DeepReader takes a modular approach, relying on microservices for most of the functionality.
